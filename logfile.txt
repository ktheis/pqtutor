Does the magnitude of the answer make sense, given that 5.00 g of HCl react?

a) Mg has a smaller molar mass and a smaller coefficient than HCl, so we would expect m[Mg] < m[HCl]

b) Mg has a larger molar mass and a larger coefficient than HCl, so we would expect m[Mg] < m[HCl]

c) Mg has a smaller molar mass and a smaller coefficient than HCl, so we would expect m[Mg] > m[HCl]

<h3>Example 9.9: Using the Ideal Gas Law</h3>



<h4>Using the Ideal Gas Law</h4>

Methane, CH4, is being considered for use as an alternative automotive fuel to replace gasoline. One gallon of gasoline could be replaced by 655 g of CH4. What is the volume of this much methane at 25 °aC and 745 mmHg?

<h4>Solution</h4>

T = 25. °aC

P = 745. mmHg

P using atm

R = 0.08206 L atm / (mol K)

m[CH4] = 655 g

The ideal gas law may be used to figure out the volume of a gas, but apart from temperature T_, pressure P_, and universal gas constant R_, we also need to know the chemical amount of methane, n[CH4]:   

@P V[CH4(g)] = n[CH4] R T

Mass and chemical amount of a pure substance are related through its molar mass:

@m[CH4] = n[CH4] M[CH4]

M[CH4] = 16.043g/mol

n[CH4] = m[CH4] / M[CH4]

V[CH4(g)] = n[CH4] R T / P

<p>It would require 1020 L of gaseous methane at about 1 atm of pressure to replace 1 gal of gasoline. It requires a large container to hold enough methane at 1 atm to replace several gallons of gasoline.</p>

This is an oxidation-reduction reaction, so start by collecting the species given into an unbalanced oxidation half-reaction and an unbalanced reduction half-reaction.</p>

!oxidation (unbalanced): 2Cr^3+ (aq) -> Cr2O7^2- (aq)



<p>In acidic solution, we can use or generate hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>). Adding seven water molecules to the left side provides the necessary oxygen; the “left over” hydrogen appears as 14 H<sup>+</sup> on the right:</p>

!oxidation (unbalanced): 2Cr^3+ (aq) + 7H2O(l) -> Cr2O7^2- (aq) + 14H+ (aq)

<p>The left side of the equation has a total charge of [2 × (+3) = +6], and the right side a total charge of [−2 + 14 × (+1) = +12]. The difference is six; adding six electrons to the right side produces a mass- and charge-balanced oxidation half-reaction (in acidic solution):</p>



!oxidation (balanced): 2Cr^3+ (aq) + 7H2O(l) -> Cr2O7^2- (aq) + 14H+ (aq) + 6e−

<p>Now work on the reduction. It is necessary to convert the four oxygen atoms in the permanganate into four water molecules. To do this, add eight H+ to convert the oxygen into four water molecules:</p>

!reduction (unbalanced): MnO4^- (aq) + 8H+ (aq) -> Mn^2+ (aq) + 4H2O(l)

<p>Then add five electrons to the left side to balance the charge:</p>

!reduction (balanced): MnO4^- (aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e- -> Mn^2+ (aq) + 4H2O(l)

<p>Make sure to check the half-reaction:</p>

<h4>Answer:</h4>

N[NH3] = ?
n[Ca(OH)2] = 4.0 mol

@n[NH3] / n[Ca(OH)2] = (2/1)

<h4>Answer:</h4>



a) 

Ox[K] = 1

Ox[O] = -2

Charge = 0

@ Ox[K] + Ox[N] + 3 * Ox[O] = Charge

 

Ox[N] = Charge - Ox[K] - 3 Ox[O]

Ox[Al] = 0 - 3 Ox[H] 

(c) Nitrogen in NH+4

Ox[P] = Charge -2Ox[H] -4Ox[O] 

Think about it: Why does hydrogen have a -1 oxidation number in AlH3, but a +1 oxidation number otherwise?

a) Because in the formula, the hydrogen atoms are listed last, like an anion

b*) Because it is combined with a metal

c) Because for hydrogen, +1 is the same as -1

d) Because AlH3 is a compound and not an ion



<h3>Example 4.6b: Describing Redox Reactions</h3>



This equation describes the production of tin(II) chloride:



!Sn(s) +2HCl(g) -> SnCl2(s) +H2(g)

Is this a redox reaction? If so, provide a more specific name for the reaction if appropriate, and identify the oxidant and reductant.





<h4>Answer:</h4>



Plan: Figure out the oxidation numbers for each type of atom before and after the reaction. If any of them change, it is a redox reaction.

Ox[Sn\ in\ Sn(s)] = 0

Reasoning: it's elemental, my dear Dr. Watson

Ox[Sn\ in\ SnCl2(s)] = +2

Reasoning: it has to be positive because chloride has a negative oxidation number

Ox[H\ in\ HCl(g)] = +1

Reasoning: chloride is -1

Ox[H\ in\ H2(g)] = 0

Reasoning: It's elemental, my dear Dr. Watson

In the course of the reaction, tin becomes oxidized and hydrogen becomes reduced, so HCl is the oxidant and tin the reductant.

Think about it: What general statement is true and would be a great shortcut for figuring out this exercise?

a) The reductant always contains an atom that is a metal

b) The oxidant is always oxygen

c*) Reactions with elements are typically redox

d) Redox reactions always have two reactants and two products



<h3>Example 4.7b: Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic Solution</h3>



In acidic solution, hydrogen peroxide reacts with Fe^2+ to produce Fe^3 + and H2O. Write a balanced equation for this reaction.





!<h4>Answer:</h4>

chemical equation?
!H2O2 + Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+ + H2O (unbalanced)

Fe is balanced, H is balanced, but O and charges are not. It is a redox reaction (for example, Fe changes oxidation number), so we will first balance half reactions

!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+ + e-\ (oxidation\ half\ reaction)



!H2O2 -> 2H2O\ (reduction\ half\ reaction)

!H2O2 + 2H+ -> 2H2O\ (O\ balanced,\ H\ balanced,\ electrons\ not)

!H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e- -> 2H2O\ (balanced)



Now make sure the same number of electrons appears in the two half reactions. Here, we multiply all coefficients in the oxidation half reaction by 2:

!2 Fe^2+ -> 2 Fe^3+ + 2e−

and add the two half reactions

!2 Fe^2+ + H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e- -> 2 Fe^3+ + 2e− + 2 H2O

!2 Fe^2+ + H2O2 + 2H+ -> 2 Fe^3+ + 2 H2O (balanced\ redox\ equation)

Think about it: How do we know how to divide the unbalanced reaction into two half reactions?

a) First, find the atoms that change oxidation numbers

b) Metals in one half reaction, non-metals in the other

c) It doesn't matter, just divide them up any way

d) Charged species in one half reaction, uncharged ones in the other



<h3>Example 4.3b: Predicting Precipitation Reactions</h3>



Which solution could be used to precipitate the barium ion, Ba^2+, in a water sample: sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, or sodium sulfate? What is the formula for the expected precipitate?





<h4>Answer:</h4>

chemical formula?

Barium ion is a cation.

Check the anions to see whether they would form a precipitate with barium ions.

Sulfate forms the least soluble salts with barium.

!SO4^2- (aq) + Ba^2+ (aq) -> BaSO4 v
! BaSO4 ! forms as a precipitate

Think about it: What information is sufficient to figure this out?
a) You need the periodic table
b) You need solubility rules
c) You need to know the charges of the ions
d) You need to look up the molar masses of all species

<h3>Example 4.4b: Writing Equations for Acid-Base Reactions</h3>

Write the net ionic equation representing the neutralization of any strong acid with an ionic hydroxide. (Hint: Consider the ions produced when a strong acid is dissolved in water.)





<h4>Answer:</h4> 

chemical equation?
Strong Acid:

!HA + H2O -> H3O+ + A-

Strong Base:

!B + H2O -> BH+ + OH-

When you react strong acid with strong base, the hydronium and hydroxide ion concentrations are both high, and they react with each other to form water

!H3O+ + OH- -> 2 H2O

Think about it: What does neutralization mean?

a) Any reaction that forms a salt

b) Any reaction where one of the products is water

c*) A reaction between an acid and a base

d) A reaction that results in a solution with a neutral pH



<h3>Example 4.2b: Molecular and Ionic Equations</h3>



Diatomic chlorine and sodium hydroxide (lye) are commodity chemicals produced in large quantities, along with diatomic hydrogen, via the electrolysis of brine, according to the following unbalanced equation:



! NaCl(aq) +H2O(l) ->[electricity] NaOH(aq) +H2(g) +Cl2(g)

Write balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations for this process.





<h4>Answer:</h4>

chemical equation?



!NaCl + H2O -> NaOH + H2 + Cl2

Na and O are balanced, H and Cl are not.

!NaCl + H2O -> NaOH + 1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2

Balanced. Multiply all coefficients by two to make it nicer:

!2NaCl + 2H2O -> 2NaOH + H2 + Cl2 !(molecular)

NaCl and NaOH dissociate in water. Na is a metal which forms Na+ ions. The anions Cl- and OH- could be deduced from that information, but they, too, are common ions.

!2Na+ + 2Cl- + 2H2O -> 2Na+ + 2OH- + H2 + Cl2 !(complete ionic)

Drop the sodium ions that occur on both sides for the net ionic equation

!2Cl- + 2H2O -> 2OH- + H2 + Cl2 !(net ionic)

Think about it: How come we did not use the half-reaction method (showing the electron transfer) to balance the molecular equation?

a) This reaction is not a redox reaction because it does not involved transition metals
b*) If all species are neutral, you can get away with it
c) We know this reaction happens at neutral pH because the reactants are neither acid nor base
d) The electricity provides the electrons, so there is no electron transfer



<h3>Example 4.8b: Moles of Reactant Required in a Reaction</h3>



How many moles of Ca(OH)2 are required to react with 1.36 mol of H3PO4 to produce Ca3(PO4)2 according to the equation

!3Ca(OH)2 +2H3PO4 -> Ca3(PO4)2 +6H2O?





<h4>Answer:</h4>

n[H3PO4] = 1.36 mol

n[Ca(OH)2] = ?

ν[H3PO4] = 2
ν[Ca(OH)2] = 3
The equation is balanced, so we can go ahead and use the coefficients

@ n[Ca(OH)2] /n[H3PO4]  = (3/2)

n[Ca(OH)2] = (ν[Ca(OH)2]/ν[H3PO4]) n[H3PO4] 



Think about it: The chemical equation says that 3 moles of calcium hydroxide react with 2 moles of phosphoric acid. How does this statement relate to your calculation?

a) In both cases, the chemical amount of phosphoric acid is higher than that of calcium hydroxide

b*) In both cases, the chemical amount of phosphoric acid is lower than that of calcium hydroxide

c) The chemical amount of phosphoric acid should be lower than that of calcium hydroxide, but my calculation suggests the opposite

d) The chemical amount of phosphoric acid should be higher than that of calcium hydroxide, but my calculation suggests the opposite



<h3>Example 4.10b: Relating Masses of Reactants and Products</h3>



What mass of gallium oxide, Ga2O3, can be prepared from 29.0 g of gallium metal? The equation for the reaction is

!4Ga +3O2 -> 2Ga2O3





<h4>Answer:</h4>



m[Ga] = 29.0 g

m[Ga2O3] = ?

ν[Ga2O3] = 2
ν[Ga]  = 4


@n[Ga2O3] /n[Ga] = ν[Ga2O3]/ν[Ga]

n[Ga] = m[Ga] /M[Ga] 

n[Ga2O3] = (ν[Ga2O3]/ν[Ga]) n[Ga]  

m[Ga2O3] = n[Ga2O3] M[Ga2O3] 

Think about it: Do you expect the mass of Ga2O3 produced to be higher or lower than that of the elemental Ga reacting?

a) It would be lower because the coefficient is lower, i.e. the chemical amount of Ga2O3 is smaller than that of elemental Ga

b) It would be lower because gallium is losing electrons in this redox reaction

c*) It would be higher because all of the gallium is turned into the oxide, now with some oxygen attached

d) It would be higher because whenever you make a high molar mass product from a low molar mass reactant, you observe a mass increase



<h3>Example 4.11b: Relating Masses of Reactants</h3>



What mass of CO is required to react with 25.13 g of Fe2O3 according to the equation

!Fe2O3 +3CO -> 2Fe +3CO2





<h4>Answer:</h4>

m[Fe2O3] = 25.13 g

m[CO] = ?

@n[CO] /n[Fe2O3] =ν[CO]/ν[Fe2O3]

n[Fe2O3] = m[Fe2O3] / M[Fe2O3] 

ν[CO] = 3
ν[Fe2O3] = 1

n[CO] = (ν[CO]/ν[Fe2O3]) n[Fe2O3] 

m[CO] = n[CO] M[CO] 

Think about it: Without doing the actual calculation, we can predict

a) that the mass of CO is higher than the mass of Fe2O3 because of the 3:1 stoichiometric ratio

b) that the mass of Fe2O3 is higher than the mass of CO because the molar mass of Fe2O3 is higher

c) nothing because one species has the higher coefficient while the other one has the higher molar mass

d) nothing because the chemical equation is not balanced yet



<h3>Example 4.12b: Identifying the Limiting Reactant</h3>



Which is the limiting reactant when 5.00 g of H2 and 10.0 g of O2 react and form water?





<h4>Answer:</h4>


n[->] = ?

m[H2] = 5.00 g

m[O2] = 10.0 g

! H2 + O2 -> H2O

! H2 + 1/2 O2 -> H2O

! 2 H2 + O2 -> 2 H2O

Plan 1) balanced chemical equation 2) chemical amounts of reactants 3) find which is limiting

n[H2] = m[H2] / M[H2]

n[O2] = m[O2] / M[O2]  

n[->] = min(n[H2] /2, n[O2] /1)

O2 is limiting

Think about it: Without doing any math,

a) we know that H2 is limiting because there is a lower mass of it available

b) we know that O2 is limiting because it has the lower stoichiometric coefficient

c) we know that O2 is limiting because it has the higher molar mass

d) we don't know what is limiting because we have to consider all these aspects



<h3>Example 4.13b: Calculation of Percent Yield</h3>

What is the percent yield of a reaction that produces 12.5 g of the gas Freon CF2Cl2 from 32.9 g of CCl4 and excess HF?

!CCl4 +2HF -> CF2Cl2 +2HCl



<h4>Answer:</h4>

m_Freon_actual = 12.5 g

m[CCl4] = 32.9 g

yield_relative = ?

Plan 1) n[CCl4] 2) n_Freon,theoretical 3) n_Freon,actual 4) yield

n[CCl4] = m[CCl4] / M[CCl4] 

@ n_Freon / n[CCl4] = 1/1

n_Freon_theoretical = n[CCl4] * (1/1) 

n_Freon_actual = m_Freon_actual / M[CF2Cl2]

yield_relative = n_Freon_actual / n_Freon_theoretical * 100 ％

Think about it: Given that the stoichiometry between CCl4 and CCl2F2 is 1:1 and their molar masses are not that different (153 vs 121 g/mol), would you have expected a good or a poor yield?

a) A good yield because the mass of the product is similar to that of the reactant

b) A poor yield because the mass of the product is similar to that of the reactant

c) A good yield because the mass of the product is much lower than that of the reactant

d*) A poor yield because the mass of the product is much lower than that of the reactant



<h3>Example 4.14b: Titration Analysis</h3>



A 20.00-mL sample of aqueous oxalic acid, H2C2O4, was titrated with a 0.09113-<em>M</em> solution of potassium permanganate.



!2MnO4- (aq) +5H2C2O4(aq) +6H+ (aq) -> 10CO2(g) +2 Mn^2+ (aq) +8H2O(l)

A volume of 23.24 mL was required to reach the end point. What is the oxalic acid concentration?





<h4>Answer:</h4>

V_oxalic = 20.00 mL

c[MnO4-] = 0.09113 M

V[MnO4-] = 23.24 mL

c_oxalic = ?

@n_oxalic / n[MnO4-] = 5/2

n[MnO4-] = c[MnO4-] V[MnO4-] 

n_oxalic = (5/2) n[MnO4-]  

c_oxalic = n_oxalic / V_oxalic



Think about it: Given that the volumes of oxalic acid solution and potassium permanganate solution at the end point are similar, is it surprising that the concentration of oxalic acid is more than two times that of the permanganate?

a*) No, because they react in a ratio of 5:2

b) No, because the end point is always reached at equal volumes of analyte and titrant

c) Yes, because the concentrations should be similar if the volumes are similar

d) Yes, because permanganate is a stronger oxidizing agent than oxalic acid



<h3>Example 4.15b: Gravimetric Analysis</h3>



What is the percent of chloride ion in a sample if 1.1324 g of the sample produces 1.0881 g of AgCl when treated with excess Ag^ +?



!Ag +(aq) +Cl- (aq) -> AgCl(s)



<h4>Answer:</h4>

f[Cl]mass = ?

m_sample = 1.1324 g

m[AgCl] = 1.0881 g

@ n[Cl-] / n[AgCl] = 1/1

n[AgCl] = m[AgCl] / M[AgCl]

n[Cl-] = n[AgCl] * (1/1) 

m[Cl] = n[Cl-] * M[Cl] 

f[Cl]mass = m[Cl] /m_sample * 100 ％

Think about it: What has to be another main component of the sample: anions such as Br-, cations such as Na+, unreactive atoms such as Xe or molecules such as glucose?

a) Anions such as Br- ions because they are in the same group of the periodic table

b) Cations such as Na+ because they would act as counterions for the chloride ions

c) Molecules such as glucose because they would neutralize the charge of the Cl- ions

d) Unreactive atoms such as Xenon because they could shield the charge of the Cl- ions



<h3>Example 4.16b: Combustion Analysis</h3>

m[H2O] = 0.00148 g

! C + ... -> CO2 + ...

!H + ... -> 1/2 H2O + ...

n[CO2] = m[CO2] / M[CO2]

n[H2O] = m[H2O] / M[H2O]  

n[C] = n[CO2]

n[H] = 2 n[H2O]  

ratio[H:C] = n[H] /n[C] 

The empirical formula of the polymer polystyrene is CH, and the actual formula is (CH)x, where x is a high number because it is a polymer, i.e. high molar mass compound.

Think about it: Is it surprising that the calculated ratio is not exactly an integer?

a) Yes, we expect integers according to Daltons law of integer proportions

<h3>Example 5.1: Measuring Heat</h3>

<h4>Measuring Heat</h4>

A flask containing 8.0e2 g of water is heated, and the temperature of the water increases from 21 °C to 85 °C. How much heat did the water absorb?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m[H2O] = 8.0e2g

T_initial = 21. °aC

T_final = 85. °aC

q[H2O] = ?

To answer this question, consider these factors:

- the specific heat of the substance being heated (in this case, water)

- the amount of substance being heated (in this case, 800 g)

- the magnitude of the temperature change (in this case, from 21 °C to 85 °C).



The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g °C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C requires 4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need <em>800 times as much</em> to heat 800 g of water by 1 °C. Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need <em>64 times as much</em> to heat it by 64 °C (that is, from 21 °C to 85 °C).

c[H2O] = 4.184 J/(g °ΔC)

This can be summarized using the equation q = c[H2O] m[H2O] ΔT_ with ΔT = T_final - T_initial

ΔT = T_final - T_initial

q[H2O] = c[H2O] m[H2O] ΔT

q[H2O] using kJ

Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and q[H2O] is positive.







<h3>Example 5.2: Determining Other Quantities</h3>





<h4>Determining Other Quantities</h4>

A piece of unknown metal weighs 348 g. When the metal piece absorbs 6.64 kJ of heat, its temperature increases from 22.4 °C to 43.6 °C. Determine the specific heat of this metal (which might provide a clue to its identity).



<h4>Solution</h4>

m_unknown = 348. g

q_piece = 6.64 kJ

T_initial = 22.4 °aC

T_final = 43.6 °aC

c_unknown = ?

Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine its specific heat using the relationship:



@q = c m_ ΔT = c m_ (T_final - T_initial)

Solving for c:

@ c = q / (m_ ΔT)

Substituting the known quantities:

c_unknown = q_piece / ( m_unknown (T_final - T_initial))

c_unknown using J

Comparing this value with the values in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/5-1-energy-basics/#fs-idm68801008">Table 1</a>, this value matches the specific heat of aluminum, which suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.




<h3>Example 5.3: Heat Transfer between Substances at Different Temperatures</h3>

<h4>Heat Transfer between Substances at Different Temperatures</h4>
A 360-g piece of rebar (a steel rod used for reinforcing concrete) is dropped into 425 mL of water at 24.0 °C. The final temperature of the water was measured as 42.7 °C. Calculate the initial temperature of the piece of rebar. Assume the specific heat of steel is approximately the same as that for iron (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/5-1-energy-basics/#fs-idm68801008">Table 1</a>), and that all heat transfer occurs between the rebar and the water (there is no heat exchange with the surroundings).

<h4>Solution</h4>
m_rebar = 360. g
V_water = 425. mL
T[H2O]initial = 24.0 °aC
T_final = 42.7 °aC
T_rebar_inital = ?

The temperature of the water increases from 24.0 °C to 42.7 °C, so the water absorbs heat. That heat came from the piece of rebar, which initially was at a higher temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the rebar and the water, with no heat “lost” to the surroundings, then <em>heat given off by rebar = -heat taken in by water</em>, or:

@q_rebar = -q_water
Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:

@(c_rebar m_rebar ΔT_rebar)= - (c_water m_water ΔT_water)
#Letting f = final and i = initial, in expanded form, this becomes:

@ crebar mrebar (Tf_rebar - Ti_rebar)= - cwater mwater (Tf_water - Ti_water)
Solving for Ti_rebar
@ T_initial_rebar = c_water/c_rebar (m_water/m_rebar) (T_final - T_initial_water) + T_final

The density of water is 1.00 g/mL, so 425 mL of water has a mass of 425 g.
ρ[H2O] = 1.00 g/mL
m_water = V_water ρ[H2O]
The specific heats are:
c_water = 4.184J/(g °ΔC)
c_rebar = 0.449J/(g °ΔC)
Ti_rebar = c_water/c_rebar (m_water/m_rebar) (T_final - T[H2O]initial) + T_final
The initial temperature of the rebar was 248 °C.


<h3>Example 4.3: Predicting Precipitation Reactions</h3>



<h4>Predicting Precipitation Reactions</h4>

Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the reaction.



(a) potassium sulfate and barium nitrate



(b) lithium chloride and silver acetate



(c) lead nitrate and ammonium carbonate



<h4>Solution</h4>



(a) The two possible products for this combination are KNO3 and BaSO4. The <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/4-2-classifying-chemical-reactions/#fs-idp140132617697568">solubility guidelines</a> indicate BaSO4 is insoluble, and so a precipitation reaction is expected. The net ionic equation for this reaction, derived in the manner detailed in the previous module, is

!Ba^2+(aq) +SO4^2- (aq) -> BaSO4(s)



(b) The two possible products for this combination are LiC2H3O2 and AgCl. The solubility guidelines indicate AgCl is insoluble, and so a precipitation reaction is expected. The net ionic equation for this reaction, derived in the manner detailed in the previous module, is

!Ag+(aq) +Cl- (aq) -> AgCl(s)



(c) The two possible products for this combination are PbCO3 and NH4NO3. The solubility guidelines indicate PbCO3 is insoluble, and so a precipitation reaction is expected. The net ionic equation for this reaction, derived in the manner detailed in the previous module, is

!Pb^2+(aq) +CO3^2- (aq) -> PbCO3(s)

<h3>Example 5.4: Identifying a Metal by Measuring Specific Heat</h3>



A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 °C. The final temperature is 28.5 °C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal. Use this result to identify the metal.



<h4>Solution</h4>

c_p_metal = ? # to identify the metal

m_metal = 59.7 g

V_water = 60.0 mL

T_initial_metal = 100 °aC

T_initial_water = 22.0 °aC

T_final = 28.5 °aC

Assuming perfect heat transfer, the heat given off by metal is equal to the heat taken in by water, or:

@q_metal = -q_water



In expanded form using q = c_p m_ ΔT_ this is:

@c_p_metal m_metal ΔT_metal = -c_p_water m_water ΔT_water

Solving this for c_p_metal:

@c_p_metal  = -c_p_water (m_water/m_metal)  (ΔT_water/ΔT_metal)

Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was 100.0 °C; and that 60.0 mL of water have a mass of 60.0 g, we have:

ΔT_metal = T_final - T_initial_metal

ΔT_water = T_final - T_initial_water

ρ_water = 1.000 g/mL

m_water = ρ_water V_water

c_p_water = 4.186 J/(g °ΔC)

c_p_metal  = -c_p_water (m_water/m_metal)  (ΔT_water/ΔT_metal)



Comparing this with values in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/5-1-energy-basics/#fs-idm68801008">Table 1</a>, our experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g °C), so we identify the metal as copper.



<h3>Example 5.6: Heat Flow in an Instant Ice Pack</h3>



When solid ammonium nitrate dissolves in water, the solution becomes cold. This is the basis for an “instant ice pack” (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_05_02_IcePack.jpg">Figure 16</a>). When 3.21 g of solid NH4NO3 dissolves in 50.0 g of water at 24.9 °C in a calorimeter, the temperature decreases to 20.3 °C.



Calculate the heat of reaction q_rxn for dissolving NH4NO3 and explain the meaning of its arithmetic sign. State any assumptions that you made.



#<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_05_02_IcePack.jpg" width="30%">Figure 16An instant cold pack consists of a bag containing solid ammonium nitrate and a second bag of water. When the bag of water is broken, the pack becomes cold because the dissolution of ammonium nitrate is an endothermic process that removes thermal energy from the water. The cold pack then removes thermal energy from your body.

<h4>Solution</h4>

q_rxn = ? # and discuss meaning of sign

m[NH4NO3] = 3.21 g

m[H2O] = 50.0 g

T_initial = 24.9 °aC

T_final = 20.3 °aC

We assume that the calorimeter prevents heat transfer between the solution and its external environment (including the calorimeter itself), in which case:

@q_dis = -q_soln

with “rxn” and “soln” used as shorthand for “reaction” and “solution,” respectively.

@q_soln = c_p_soln m_soln ΔT

m_soln = m[NH4NO3] + m[H2O]

ΔT = T_final - T_initial

Assuming also that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that for water, we have:

c_p_soln = 4.184J/(g °ΔC)

q_soln = c_p_soln m_soln ΔT

q_rxn = -q_soln

The positive sign for <em>q</em> indicates that the reaction is an endothermic process. (If a reaction cools down the surrounding, it is endothermic.)



<h3>Example 5.7: Bomb Calorimetry</h3>



<h4>Bomb Calorimetry</h4>

When 3.12 g of glucose, C6H12O6, is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature of the calorimeter increases from 23.8 °C to 35.6 °C. The calorimeter contains 775 g of water, and the bomb itself has a heat capacity of 893 J/°C. How much heat was produced by the combustion of the glucose sample?



<h4>Solution</h4>

q_rxn = ?

m_glucose = 3.12 g

m_water = 775. g

T_initial = 23.8 °aC

T_final = 35.6 °aC

C_V_bomb = 893 J/°ΔC

c_V_water = 4.1371 J/(g °ΔC) # book says 4.184J/(g °ΔC)

The combustion produces heat that is primarily absorbed by the water and the bomb. (The amounts of heat absorbed by the reaction products and the unreacted excess oxygen are relatively small and dealing with them is beyond the scope of this text. We will neglect them in our calculations.)



The heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the water and the bomb:

@q_rxn = -(q_water + q_bomb)

@q_water = c_V_water m_water ΔT

@q_bomb = C_V_bomb ΔT

ΔT = T_final - T_initial

q_water = c_V_water m_water ΔT

q_bomb = C_V_bomb ΔT

q_rxn = -(q_water + q_bomb)

q_rxn using kJ

This reaction released 48.7 kJ of heat when 3.12 g of glucose was burned.



<h3>Example 5.8: Measurement of an Enthalpy Change</h3>



<h4>Measurement of an Enthalpy Change</h4>

When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat are produced. What is the molar enthalpy change ΔH_ (i.e. enthalpy per mole of acid reacting) for the acid-base reaction run under the conditions described in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/5-2-calorimetry/#fs-idm19242032">Example 5.4</a>?



!HCl(aq) +NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) +H2O(l)

<h4>Solution</h4>

For the reaction of 0.0500 mol acid (HCl), q = -2.9 kJ so:

n[HCl]_rxn = 0.0500 mol

q_rxn = -2.9 kJ



The heat generated depends on the amount of substance that reacts (double the reaction, double the heat), so it is an extensive quantity. On the other hand, the molar enthalpy change ΔH_ is per amount of acid reacting, so it is an intensive quantity:

ΔH = q_rxn / n[HCl]_rxn

We based the molar enthalpy change on the chemical amount of HCl reacting. When we write the thermochemical equation, we have to make sure the coefficient of HCl is "1" to reflect that:



!HCl(aq) +NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) +H2O(l)\ \ \ ΔH = -58kJ

Think about it: Is this reaction endothermic (takes up heat) or exothermic (gives off heat)?
a) Exothermic as the reaction enthalpy is positive
b) Exothermic as the reaction enthalpy is negative
c) Endothermic as the reaction enthalpy is positive
d) Endothermic as the reaction enthalpy is negative


<h3>Example 5.9: Another Example of the Measurement of an Enthalpy Change</h3>

A gummy   bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, C12H22O11. When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, KClO3, 43.7 kJ of heat are produced. Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction

!C12H22O11(aq) +8KClO3(aq) -> 12CO2 (g) +11H2O(l) +8KCl(aq)

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_sucrose = 2.67 g

m[KClO3] = 7.19 g

q_rxn = -43.7 kJ

ΔH_rxn = ?

Plan 1) How much reacts, n[->] 2) ΔH_rxn based on n[->]

n_sucrose  = m_sucrose / M[C12H22O11] 

ν_sucrose = 1

n[KClO3] = m[KClO3] / M[KClO3]

ν[KClO3] = 8

n[->] = min(n_sucrose / ν_sucrose, n[KClO3] / ν[KClO3])

ΔH_rxn = q_rxn / n[->] 

!C12H22O11 +8KClO3 -> 12CO2 +11H2O +8KCl~~~~~~~~~ΔH~=~-5960kJ/mol





<h3>Example 5.8: Measurement of an Enthalpy Change</h3>

When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat are produced.

!HCl(aq) +NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) +H2O(l)



<h4>Solution</h4>

ΔH_rxn = ?

n[HCl]_rxn = 0.0500 mol

n[NaOH]_rxn = 0.0500 mol

n[NaCl]_rxn = 0.0500 mol

q_rxn = -2.9 kJ

The heat generated depends on the amount of substance that reacts (double the reaction, double the heat), so it is an extensive quantity. On the other hand, the molar enthalpy change ΔH_ is per amount of reaction n[->], so it is an intensive quantity:

@ΔH = q_rxn / n[->]_rxn

Plan: 1) n[->] 2) ΔH_rxn

In this case, calculating n[->] is easy because it says how much of each substance is made or used up (and their ratios correspond to the 1:1:1 ratio given by the chemical equation).

ν[HCl] = 1

n[->]_rxn = n[HCl]_rxn / ν[HCl]

ΔH = q_rxn / n[->]_rxn

We could have used n[->] = n[NaOH]_rxn / ν[NaOH] or n[->] = n[NaCl]_rxn / ν[NaCl] instead...

!HCl(aq) +NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) +H2O(l) ~~~ ΔH = -58kJ/mol



<h3>Example 5.10: Using Enthalpy of Combustion</h3>

As <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_05_03_GasBurning.jpg">Figure 21</a> suggests, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic process. To approximate the amount of heat produced by burning 1.00 L of gasoline, we will do the calculation for 1.00 L of isooctane (C8H18), a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is 0.692 g/mL.



#<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_05_03_GasBurning.jpg" width="50%">Figure 21:The combustion of gasoline is very exothermic. (credit: modification of work by “AlexEagle”/Flickr)

<h4>Solution</h4>

V_isooctane = 1.00 L

ρ_isooctane = 0.692 g/mL

q_approx = ?

Plan: 1) m_isooctane 2) n_isooctane 2) q_rxn

m_isooctane = V_isooctane ρ_isooctane

n_isooctane = m_isooctane / M[C8H18]

<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/5-3-enthalpy/#fs-idp98710048">Table 2</a> gives enthalpy of combustion of isooctane as -5460 kJ/mol.

ΔH_combustion = -5460 kJ/mol

q_approx = n_isooctane ΔH_combustion



The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This amount of energy is enough to melt 99.2 kg, or about 218 lbs, of ice.)







<h3>Example 5.11: Evaluating an Enthalpy of Formation</h3>

Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products of the reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation, ΔHf° of ozone from the following information:



!3O2(g) -> 2O3(g) !ΔH = 286 kJ/mol

<h4>Solution</h4>

ΔH_298° = 286 kJ/mol

ν[O3] = 2 

ΔHf°[O3] = ?

ΔHf° is the enthalpy change per one mole of a substance formed (in its standard state from the elements in their standard states). In the chemical equation, we are making 2 moles of ozone, so we have to divide the enthalpy of reaction by the stoichiometric coefficient of ozone to account for that.

ΔHf°[O3] = ΔH_298° / ν[O3]

In other words, ΔHf° for O3(g) is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

!3/2O2(g) -> O3(g)





<h3>Example 5.12: Writing Reaction Equations for ΔHf°</h3>

Write the heat of formation reaction equations for:



!C2H5OH(l)

and

! Ca3(PO4)2(s)



<h4>Solution</h4>

Remembering that ΔHf° reaction equations are for forming 1 mole of the compound from its constituent elements under standard conditions, we have:



! ?~C(s,graphite) + ~?~H2(g) + ~?~O2(g) -> C2H5OH(l)

for the first substance, C2H5OH

To balance this, count how many of each element are found in the product, and adjust the coefficients of the elements on the reactant side, i.e. we need 2 carbons, 6 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen. For oxygen, the coefficient has to be less than one (a fraction) because one O2 molecule already contains 2 atoms of oxygen, but we need only one.

! 2C(s,graphite) +3H2(g) +1/2O2(g) -> C2H5OH(l)

and

! 3Ca(s) +1/2P4(s) +4O2(g) -> Ca3(PO4)2(s)

Note: The standard state of carbon is graphite, and phosphorus exists as P4 (you can use <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/standard-thermodynamic-properties-for-selected-substances/">appendix G</a> to find the standard forms of elements).



<h3>Example 5.13: Stepwise Calculation of ΔHf° Using Hess’s Law</h3>

Determine the enthalpy of formation, ΔHf°, of FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process that occurs under standard state conditions:



![1]~~Fe(s) +Cl2(g) -> FeCl2(s)~~~~ΔH° = -341.8kJ/mol

![2]~~FeCl2(s) +1/2Cl2(g) -> FeCl3(s)~~~~ΔH° = -57.7kJ/mol

<h4>Solution</h4>

ΔH°_rxn1 = -341.8kJ/mol

ΔH°_rxn2  = -57.7kJ/mol

We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl3(s), which is equal to ΔHf° for the reaction:

![3]~~Fe(s) +3/2Cl2(g) -> FeCl3(s)

If we add the two reactions for which we know the enthalpy, we get:

!Fe(s) +Cl2(g) + FeCl2(s) +1/2Cl2(g) -> FeCl2(s) + FeCl3(s)

To get the net reaction, remove the FeCl2 occuring both as reactnat and product, and add up the Cl2 occuring twice in the list of reactant to see that this is the reaction we need:

!Fe(s) +3/2Cl2(g) -> FeCl3(s)

According to Hess's Law, the reaction enthalpy of this reaction is the sum of the two reactions with known ΔH values:

ΔH°_rxn3  = ΔH°_rxn1 + ΔH°_rxn2



!Fe(s) +3/2Cl2(g) -> FeCl3(s)~~~~$ΔH° = -399.5$ kJ/mol

The enthalpy of formation, ΔHf°, of FeCl3(s) is -399.5 kJ/mol.



<h3>Example 5.14: A More Challenging Problem Using Hess’s Law</h3>

Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:



![1] ClF(g) +F2(g) -> ClF3(g) !ΔH_1 = ?

Use the reactions here to determine the Δ<em>H</em> for reaction [1]:



![2] 2OF2(g) -> O2(g) +2F2(g) !ΔH_2 = -49.4kJ/mol

![3] 2ClF(g) +O2(g) -> Cl2O(g) +OF2(g) !ΔH_3 = 205.6 kJ/mol

![4] ClF3(g) +O2(g) -> 1/2Cl2O(g) +3/2OF2(g) !ΔH_4 = 266.7 kJ/mol

<h4>Solution</h4>

Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions [2], [3], and [4] such that they add up to reaction [1]. Going from left to right in [1], we first see that ClF(g) is needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction [3] by 1/2, which means that the ΔH change is also multiplied by 1/2:

ΔH_3 = 205.6 kJ/mol

ΔH_3a = (1/2) ΔH_3



![3a] ClF(g) +1/2O2(g) -> 1/2Cl2O(g) +1/2OF2(g) !ΔH = 102.8 kJ/mol

Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse and halve reaction [2], which means that the ΔH changes sign and is halved:

ΔH_2 = -49.4 kJ/mol

ΔH_2a = -(1/2) ΔH_2

![2a] 1/2O2(g) +F2(g) -> OF2(g) !ΔH= 24.7 kJ/mol.

To get ClF3 as a product, reverse [4], changing the sign of ΔH:

ΔH_4 = 266.7 kJ/mol

ΔH_4a = -ΔH_4



![4a] 1/2Cl2O(g) +3/2OF2(g) -> ClF3(g) +O2(g) !ΔH=-266.7 kJ/mol

Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want. Without cancelling, we have (the equation is balanced because we added up balanced equations):

![3a+2a+4a] ClF +1/2O2 + 1/2O2 +F2 + 1/2Cl2O +3/2OF2 -> 1/2Cl2O +1/2OF2 + OF2 + ClF3 +O2

Reactants 1/2 O2 and 1/2 O2 cancel out product O2; product 1/2 Cl2O cancels reactant 1/2 Cl2O ; and reactant 3/2 OF2 is cancelled by products 1/2 OF2 and OF2. This leaves only reactants ClF and F2 and product ClF3, which are what we want. Since summing these three modified reactions yields the reaction of interest, summing the three modified ΔH values will give the desired ΔH:



ΔH = ΔH_3a + ΔH_2a + ΔH_4a



<h3>Example 5.15: Using Hess’s Law</h3>

What is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:



!3NO2(g) +H2O(l) -> 2HNO3(aq) +NO(g) !ΔH°=?

<h4>Solution: Using the Equation</h4>

Use the special form of Hess’s law given previously:



@ΔH°_rxn = sum(ν_product ΔHf°_product) - sum(ν_reactant ΔHf°_reactant)

ΔHf°[HNO3(aq)] = -207.4kJ/mol

ΔHf°[NO(g)] = 90.2 kJ/mol

ΔHf°[NO2(g)] = 33.2 kJ/mol

ΔHf°[H2O(l)] = -285.8kJ/mol

ν[HNO3(aq)] = 2

ν[NO(g)] = 1

ν[NO2(g)] = 3

ν[H2O(l)] = 1

ΔH°_rxn = sum(ΔHf°[HNO3(aq)] ν[HNO3(aq)], ΔHf°[NO(g)] ν[NO(g)]) - sum(ν[NO2(g)] ΔHf°[NO2(g)], ν[H2O(l)]  ΔHf°[H2O(l)]) 



<h4>Solution: Supporting Why the General Equation Is Valid</h4>

Alternatively, we can write this reaction as the sum of the decompositions of 3NO2(g) and 1H2O(l) into their constituent elements, and the formation of 2HNO3(aq) and 1NO(g) from their constituent elements. Writing out these reactions, and noting their relationships to the ΔHf° values for these compounds (from <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/standard-thermodynamic-properties-for-selected-substances/">Appendix G</a> ), we have:



!3NO2(g) -> 3/2N2(g) +3O2(g) !ΔH1°=-99.6kJ/mol

!H2O(l) -> H2(g) +1/2O2(g) !ΔH2°= +285.8 kJ/mol

!H2(g) +N2(g) +1/2O2(g) -> 2HNO3(aq) !ΔH3°=-414.8kJ/mol

!1/2N2(g) +1/2O2(g) -> NO(g) !ΔH4°= +90.2 kJ/mol

ΔH1°=-99.6kJ/mol

ΔH2°= +285.8 kJ/mol

ΔH3°=-414.8kJ/mol

ΔH4°= +90.2 kJ/mol

!3NO2(g) +H2O(l) -> 2HNO3(aq) +NO(g)

Summing their enthalpy changes gives the value we want to determine:



ΔHrxn°=ΔH1° +ΔH2° +ΔH3° +ΔH4°



#So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is Δ<em>H</em>° = -138.4 kJ.



Note that this result was obtained by (1) multiplying the ΔHf° of each product by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, (2) multiplying the ΔHf° of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, and then (3) subtracting the result found in (2) from the result found in (1). This is also the procedure in using the general equation, as shown.







<h3>Example 6.1: Determining the Frequency and Wavelength of Radiation</h3>

A sodium streetlight gives off yellow light that has a wavelength of 589 nm. What is the frequency of this light?



<h4>Solution</h4>

λ[Na] = 589 nm

We can rearrange the equation c0 = λ_ ν_ to solve for the frequency:



@ν_ = c0 / λ_

c0 = 2.998e8 m/s

ν[Na] = c0 / λ[Na]

<h4>Calculating the Energy of Radiation</h4>

When we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon atoms. If this radiation has a wavelength of 640 nm, what is the energy of the photon being emitted?

<h4>Solution</h4>

λ_neon = 640 nm

E_photon = ?

We use the version of Planck's equation that includes the wavelength, <em>λ</em>.

@E = h_Planck c0 / λ

c0 = 2.998e8 m/s

h_Planck = 6.626e-34 J s

E_photon = h_Planck c0 /λ_neon 



<h3>Example 6.3: Photoelectric Effect</h3>



<h4>Photoelectric Effect</h4>Identify which of the following statements are false and, where necessary, change the italicized word or phrase to make them true, consistent with Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect.

(a) Increasing the brightness of incoming light <em>increases</em> the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.



(b) Increasing the <em>wavelength</em> of incoming light increases the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.



(c) Increasing the brightness of incoming light <em>increases</em> the number of ejected electrons.



(d) Increasing the <em>frequency</em> of incoming light can increase the number of ejected electrons.



<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) False. Increasing the brightness of incoming light <em>has no effect</em> on the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. Only energy, not the number or amplitude, of the photons influences the kinetic energy of the electrons.



(b) False. Increasing the <em>frequency</em> of incoming light increases the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. Frequency is proportional to energy and inversely proportional to wavelength. Frequencies above the threshold value transfer the excess energy into the kinetic energy of the electrons.



(c) True. Because the number of collisions with photons increases with brighter light, the number of ejected electrons increases.



(d) True with regard to the threshold energy binding the electrons to the metal. Below this threshold, electrons are not emitted and above it they are. Once over the threshold value, further increasing the frequency does not increase the number of ejected electrons



<h3>Example 6.4: Calculating the Energy of an Electron in a Bohr Orbit</h3>



<h4>Calculating the Energy of an Electron in a Bohr Orbit</h4>

Early researchers were very excited when they were able to predict the energy of an electron at a particular distance from the nucleus in a hydrogen atom. If a spark promotes the electron in a hydrogen atom into an orbit with n = 3, what is the calculated energy, in joules, of the electron?



<h4>Solution</h4>

n = 3

The energy of the electron is given by this equation:



@ E = -k Z^2/n^2

The atomic number, Z, of hydrogen is 1 and k is 2.179e-18 J.

Z = 1

k = 2.179E-18 J

E = -k Z^2/n^2







<h3>Example 4.7: Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic Solution</h3>



<h4>Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic Solution</h4>

Write a balanced equation for the reaction between dichromate ion and iron(II) to yield iron(III) and chromium(III) in acidic solution.



!Cr2O7^2- +Fe^2+ -> Cr^3+ +Fe^3+

<h4>Solution</h4>



Write the two half-reactions.



Each half-reaction will contain one reactant and one product with one element in common.

!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+

!Cr2O7^2- -> Cr^3+

Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen. The iron half-reaction is already balanced, but the chromium half-reaction shows two Cr atoms on the left and one Cr atom on the right. Changing the coefficient on the right side of the equation to 2 achieves balance with regard to Cr atoms.

!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+

!Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+

Balance oxygen atoms by adding H2O molecules. The iron half-reaction does not contain O atoms. The chromium half-reaction shows seven O atoms on the left and none on the right, so seven water molecules are added to the right side.

!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+

!Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O

Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H+ ions. The iron half-reaction does not contain H atoms. The chromium half-reaction shows 14 H atoms on the right and none on the left, so 14 hydrogen ions are added to the left side.

!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+

!Cr2O7^2- +14H+ -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O

Balance charge by adding electrons. The iron half-reaction shows a total charge of 2⊕ on the left side (one Fe^2+ ion) and 3⊕ on the right side (one Fe^3+ ion). Adding one electron to the right side bring that side’s total charge to (3⊕)  + (1⊖) = 2⊕, and charge balance is achieved.



The chromium half-reaction shows a total charge of (1 * 2⊖)  + (14 * 1⊕ ) = 12⊕  on the left side (one Cr2O7^2- ion and 14 H+ ions). The total charge on the right side is (2 * 3⊕) = 6⊕ (two Cr^3+ ions). Adding six electrons to the left side will bring that side’s total charge to (12⊕   + 6⊖) = 6⊕ , and charge balance is achieved.

!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+ +e-

!Cr2O7^2- +14H+ +6e- -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O

Multiply the two half-reactions so the number of electrons in one reaction equals the number of electrons in the other reaction. To be consistent with mass conservation, and the idea that redox reactions involve the transfer (not creation or destruction) of electrons, the iron half-reaction’s coefficient must be multiplied by 6.

!6Fe^2+ -> 6Fe^3+ +6e-

!Cr2O7^2- +6e- +14H + -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O

Add the balanced half-reactions and cancel species that appear on both sides of the equation.

!6Fe^2+ +Cr2O7^2- +6e- +14H+ -> 6Fe^3+ +6e- +2Cr^3+ +7H2O

Only the six electrons are redundant species. Removing them from each side of the equation yields the simplified, balanced equation here:

! 6Fe^2+ +Cr2O7^2- +14H+ -> 6Fe^3+ +2Cr^3+ +7H2O !balanced chemical equation





A final check of atom and charge balance confirms the equation is balanced.

@Fe_reactant = Fe_product = 6

@Cr_reactant = Cr_product = 2

@O_reactant = O_product = 7

@H_reactant = H_product = 14

@Charge_reactant = Charge_product = 24



<h3>Example 6.5: Calculating the Energy and Wavelength of Electron Transitions in a One–electron (Bohr) System</h3>

What is the energy (in joules) and the wavelength (in meters) of the line in the spectrum of hydrogen that represents the movement of an electron from Bohr orbit with n = 4 to the orbit with n = 6? In what part of the electromagnetic spectrum do we find this radiation?



<h4>Solution</h4>

In this case, the electron starts out with n = 4 and comes to rest in the n = 6 orbit, so 

n1 = 4

n2 = 6

The difference in energy between the two states is given by this expression:



@ΔE_electron = E1_electron - E2_electron = 2.179E-18J (1/n1^2-1/n2^2)

ΔE_electron = 2.179E-18J (1/n1^2-1/n2^2)

This energy difference is positive, indicating a photon enters the system (is absorbed) to excite the electron from then = 4 orbit up to the n = 6 orbit. The wavelength of a photon with this energy is found by the expression 

@E_photon = h_Planck c0 / λ_photon

E_photon = ΔE_electron

c0 = 2.998E8 m/s

h_Planck = 6.626E-34 J s

Rearrangement gives:

λ = h_Planck c0 / E_photon

λ using μm

From <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_06_01_emspectrum.jpg">Figure 3</a>, we can see that this wavelength is found in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.



<h3>Example 6.6: Calculating the Wavelength of a Particle</h3>

If an electron travels at a velocity of 1.000e7 m/s and has a mass of 9.109e-28 g, what is its wavelength?



<h4>Solution</h4>

v_elec = 1.000E7 m/s

m_elec = 9.109E-28 g

We can use de Broglie’s equation to solve this problem

@λ = h_Planck / (m_ v_)

h_Planck = 6.626E-34 J s

λ_elec = h_Planck / (m_elec v_elec)

λ_elec using Å

This is a small value, but it is significantly larger than the size of an electron in the classical (particle) view. This size is the same order of magnitude as the size of an atom. This means that electron wavelike behavior is going to be noticeable in an atom.



<h3>Example 6.7: Working with Shells and Subshells</h3>



Indicate the number of subshells, the number of orbitals in each subshell, and the values of l_  and m_ℓ  for the orbitals in the n_  = 4 shell of an atom.



<h4>Solution</h4>

For n_  = 4, ℓ_  can have values of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Thus, s_ , p_ , d_ , and f_  subshells are found in the n_  = 4 shell of an atom. For ℓ_  = 0 (the s_  subshell), m_ℓ  can only be 0. Thus, there is only one [4s]  orbital. For ℓ_  = 1 (p_ -type orbitals), m_ℓ  can have values of –1, 0, +1, so we find three 4p_  orbitals. For ℓ_  = 2 (d_ -type orbitals), m_ℓ  can have values of -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, so we have five 4d_  orbitals. When ℓ_  = 3 (f_ -type orbitals), m_ℓ  can have values of -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, and we can have seven 4f_  orbitals. Thus, we find a total of 16 orbitals in the n_  = 4 shell of an atom.



<h3>Example 6.8: Maximum Number of Electrons</h3>



Calculate the maximum number of electrons that can occupy a shell with (a) n_ equal to  2, (b) n_ equal to 5, and (c) n_ as a variable. Note you are only looking at the orbitals with the specified n_ value, not those at lower energies.



<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) When n_ is 2, there are four orbitals (a single 2s orbital, and three orbitals labeled 2p). These four orbitals can contain eight electrons.



(b) When n_ is 5, there are five subshells of orbitals that we need to sum:





1 orbital labeled 5s

3 orbitals labeled 5p

5 orbitals labeled 5d

7 orbitals labeled 5f

9 orbitals labeled 5g

25 orbitals total

Again, each orbital holds two electrons, so 50 electrons can fit in this shell.



(c) The number of orbitals in any shell n_ will be N_orbital = n_ ^ 2 . There can be up to two electrons in each orbital, so the maximum number of electrons will be N_electrons = 2 * n_ ^ 2



<h3>Example 6.10: Quantum Numbers and Electron Configurations</h3>

What is the electron configuration and orbital diagram for a phosphorus atom? What are the four quantum numbers for the last electron added?



<h4>Solution</h4>

The atomic number of phosphorus is 15. Thus, a phosphorus atom contains 15 electrons. The order of filling of the energy levels is 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, . . . The 15 electrons of the phosphorus atom will fill up to the 3p orbital, which will contain three electrons:

!1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^3



{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_06_04_PhosphOrb_img.jpg"}



The last electron added is a 3p electron. Therefore, n = 3 and, for a p-type orbital, l = 1. The m_l value could be -1, 0, or +1. The three p orbitals are degenerate, so any of these m_l values is correct. For unpaired electrons, convention assigns the value of +1/2 for the spin quantum number; thus, m_s is +1/2.

<h4>Predicting Electron Configurations of Ions</h4>

What is the electron configuration and orbital diagram of:



(a) Na^+



(b) P^3–



(c) Al^2+



(d) Fe^2+



(e) Sm^3+



<h4>Solution</h4>

First, write out the electron configuration for each parent atom. We have chosen to show the full, unabbreviated configurations to provide more practice for students who want it, but listing the core-abbreviated electron configurations is also acceptable.



Next, determine whether an electron is gained or lost. Remember electrons are negatively charged, so ions with a positive charge have <em>lost</em> an electron. For main group elements, the last orbital gains or loses the electron. For transition metals, the last s orbital loses an electron before the d orbitals.



! Na: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^1

<h3>Example 6.12: Sorting Atomic Radii</h3>



Predict the order of increasing covalent radius for Ge, Fl, Br, Kr.



<h4>Solution</h4>

Radius increases as we move down a group, so Ge < Fl (Note: Fl is the symbol for flerovium, element 114, NOT fluorine). Radius decreases as we move across a period, so Kr < Br < Ge. Putting the trends together, we obtain Kr < Br < Ge < Fl.



<h3>Example 6.13: Ranking Ionization Energies</h3>



Predict the order of increasing energy for the following processes: E_I1 for Al, E_I1 for Tl, E_I2 for Na, E_I3 for Al.



<h4>Solution</h4>

Removing the 6p^1 electron from Tl is easier than removing the 3p^1 electron from Al because the higher n orbital is farther from the nucleus, so IE1(Tl) < IE1(Al). Ionizing the third electron from Al(Al^2+ -> Al^3+ +e-) requires more energy because the cation Al^2+ exerts a stronger pull on the electron than the neutral Al atom, so IE1(Al) < IE3(Al). The second ionization energy for sodium removes a core electron, which is a much higher energy process than removing valence electrons. Putting this all together, we obtain: IE1(Tl) < IE1(Al) < IE3(Al) < IE2(Na).

<h3>Example 6.6b: Calculating the Wavelength of a Particle</h3>
Calculate the wavelength of a softball with a mass of 100 g traveling at a velocity of 35 m s^–1, assuming that it can be modeled as a single particle.
<h4>Answer:</h4>
We never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.
m_softball = 100. g
v_softball = 35. m/s
λ_Broglie = ?
@λ_Broglie = h_Planck / (m_ v)
h_Planck = 6.626070040(81)e-34 J s
λ_Broglie = h_Planck / (m_softball v_softball )
Think about it: How fast is the baseball in miles per hour?
a) More than 35 mph
b) Less than 35 mph
c) It depends on its mass

<h3>Example J.1b: Area of a table</h3>

If our table is 2.1 m in length and 1.4 m in width and has the shape of a rectangle, what is its area?

<h4>Answer:</h4>


L_table = 2.1 m
W_table = 1.4 m
A_table = ?
A_table = L_table * W_table
The table has an area of 2.94 square meters.

<h3>Example J.1: Area of a table</h3>

If our table is 1.80 m in length and 1.20 m in width and has the shape of a rectangle, what is its area? We might want to paint the top of the table, and need to know its area to figure out how much paint we need.

<h4>Solution</h4>
First we write down what we know, giving it names that remind us what the values are about:

L_table = 1.80 m
W_table = 1.20 m
Then we write down what we are planning on calculating. Here, it is the area of the table, A_table
A_table = ?
Now we make a plan. The area A_ of a rectangle is equal to its length L_ times its width W_ . The formula would be:
@ A_ = L_ * W_
Finally, we can ask PQcalc to do the calculation for us:
A_table = L_table * W_table
The table has an area of 2.16 square meters.

If our table is 2.1 m in length and 1.4 m in width and has the shape of a rectangle, what is its circumference (or perimeter)? We might want to glue a ribbon around the edge, and we want to know how long it has to be.

<h4>Answer:</h4>
bla bla

L_table = 2.1 m
W_table = 1.4 m
perimeter_table = ?
perimeter_table = 2 L_table + 2 W_table
The table has an area of 7.0 meters.

<h3>Example J.2: Circumference of a table</h3>

If our table is 1.80 m in length and 1.20 m in width and has the shape of a rectangle, what is its circumference (or perimeter)? We might want to glue a ribbon around the edge, and we want to know how long it has to be.

<h4>Solution</h4>
First we write down what we know, giving it names that remind us what the values are about:

L_table = 1.80 m
W_table = 1.20 m
Then we write down what we are planning on calculating. Here, it is the perimeter
perimeter = ?
Now we make a plan. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to its twice its length L_ plus twice its width W_ . The formula would be:
@ perimeter = 2 * L_ + 2 * W_
Finally, we can ask PQcalc to do the calculation for us:
perimeter = 2 L_table + 2 W_table
The table has a perimeter of 6.00 meters.

<h4>Answer:</h4>
blablabla

pieces = 21600
children = 300
I_get = ?
You would divide the pieces equally among the children
I_get = pieces / children
If divided equally, each child gets 72 pieces of candy



<h3>Example J.3: Sharing</h3>
If there are 20 cookies, and 4 people in the family, how many cookies does everyone get?
<h4>Solution</h4>

total = 20

cookies_each = total / eaters
If divided equally, everyone can eat 5 cookies

<h4>Computing Molecular Mass for a Covalent Compound</h4>

Ibuprofen, C13H18O2, is a covalent compound and the active ingredient in several popular nonprescription pain medications, such as Advil and Motrin. What is the molecular mass (Da) for this compound?

<h4>Solution</h4>

Molecules of this compound are comprised of 13 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms. Following the approach described above, the average molecular mass for this compound is therefore:

<h3>Example 3.2: Computing Formula Mass for an Ionic Compound</h3>

<h4>Computing Formula Mass for an Ionic Compound</h4>

Aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ionic compound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various water purification processes. What is the formula mass (Da) of this compound?

<h4>Solution</h4>

The formula for this compound indicates it contains Al^3+ and SO4^2- ions combined in a 2:3 ratio. For purposes of computing a formula mass, it is helpful to rewrite the formula in the simpler format, Al2S3O12. Following the approach outlined above, the formula mass for this compound is calculated as follows:

<h3>Example 3.3: Deriving Moles from Grams for an Element</h3>

<h4>Deriving Moles from Grams for an Element</h4>

According to nutritional guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture, the estimated average requirement for dietary potassium is 4.7 g. What is the estimated average requirement of potassium in moles?

<h4>Solution</h4>

The mass of K is provided, and the corresponding amount of K in moles is requested. 

m[K] = 4.7 g

n[K] = ?

Referring to the periodic table, the molar mass of K is 39.10 g/mol. The given mass of K (4.7 g) is a bit more than one-tenth of the mass of one mole (39.10 g), so a reasonable “ballpark” estimate of the number of moles would be slightly greater than 0.1 mol.

The molar amount of a substance may be calculated by dividing its mass (g) by its molar mass (g/mol):

n[K] = m[K] / M[K]

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_potassium_img.jpg"}

The factor-label method supports this mathematical approach since the unit “g” cancels and the answer has units of “mol:”

The calculated chemical amount of K (0.12 mol) is consistent with our ballpark expectation, since it is a bit greater than 0.1 mol.
<h3>Example 3.4: Deriving Grams from Moles for an Element</h3>

<h4>Deriving Grams from Moles for an Element</h4>

A liter of air contains 9.2e-4 mol argon. What is the mass of Ar in a liter of air?

<h4>Solution</h4>

n[Ar] = 9.2e-4 mol

m[Ar] = ?

The chemical amount of Ar is provided and must be used to derive the corresponding mass in grams. Since the amount of Ar is less than 1 mole, the mass will be less than the mass of 1 mole of Ar, approximately 40 g. The molar amount in question is approximately one-one thousandth (~10^-3) of a mole, and so the corresponding mass should be roughly one-one thousandth of the molar mass (~0.04 g):

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_argon_img.jpg"}

The molar mass M is defined as

@ M_ = m_ /n_

Solving for m gives

@ m_ = n_ * M_

m[Ar] = n[Ar] * M[Ar]

The result is in agreement with our expectations, around 0.04 g Ar.
<h3>Example 3.5: Deriving Number of Atoms from Mass for an Element</h3>

<h4>Deriving Number of Atoms from Mass for an Element</h4>

Copper is commonly used to fabricate electrical wire (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_copper.jpg">Figure 8</a>). How many copper atoms are in 5.00 g of copper wire?

<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_copper.jpg">Figure 8Copper wire is composed of many, many atoms of Cu. (credit: Emilian Robert Vicol)

<h4>Solution</h4>

m[Cu] = 5.00 g

N[Cu]atoms = ?

The number of Cu atoms in the wire may be conveniently derived from its mass by a two-step computation: first calculating the chemical amount of Cu, and then using Avogadro’s constant N_A to convert this amount to number of Cu atoms:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_copperMoles_img.jpg"}

Considering that the provided sample mass (5.00 g) is a little less than one-tenth the mass of 1 mole of Cu (~64 g), a reasonable estimate for the number of atoms in the sample would be on the order of one-tenth N_A, or approximately 1e22 Cu atoms. Carrying out the two-step computation yields:

n[Cu] = m[Cu] / M[Cu]

N_A = 6.022e23 / mol

N[Cu]atoms = N_A n[Cu]

The computed result is on the order of 1e22 as expected.
<h3>Example 3.6: Deriving Moles from Grams for a Compound</h3>

Our bodies synthesize protein from amino acids. One of these amino acids is glycine, which has the molecular formula C2H5O2N. How many moles of glycine molecules are contained in 28.35 g of glycine?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_glycine = 28.35 g

n_glycine = ?

We can derive the number of moles of a compound from its mass following the same procedure we used for an element in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/3-1-formula-mass-and-the-mole-concept/#fs-idp76540048">Example 2</a>:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_glycine_img.jpg", width="40%"}

The molar mass of glycine is required for this calculation. One mole of glycine, C2H5O2N, contains 2 moles of carbon, 5 moles of hydrogen, 2 moles of oxygen, and 1 mole of nitrogen:

M[C2H5O2N] = sum(2 M[C], 5 M[H], 2 M[O], 1M[N]) 

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_01_glycinemass_img.jpg", width="50%"}

The provided mass of glycine (~28 g) is a bit more than one-third the molar mass (~75 g/mol), so we would expect the computed result to be a bit greater than one-third of a mole (~0.33 mol). Dividing the compound’s mass by its molar mass yields:

n_glycine = m_glycine / M[C2H5O2N]

This result is consistent with our rough estimate.
<h3>Example 3.7: Deriving Grams from Moles for a Compound</h3>

Vitamin C is a covalent compound with the molecular formula C6H8O6. The recommended daily dietary allowance of vitamin C for children aged 4–8 years is 1.42e-4 mol. What is the mass of this allowance in grams?

<h4>Solution</h4>

n_VitC = 1.42e-4 mol

m_VitC = ?

As for elements, the mass of a compound can be derived from its chemical amount as shown:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_vitC_img.jpg"}

The molar mass for this compound is computed to be 176.124 g/mol. The given amount is a very small fraction of a mole (~10^-4 or one-ten thousandth); therefore, we would expect the corresponding mass to be about one-ten thousandth of the molar mass (~0.02 g). Performing the calculation, we get:
m_VitC = n_VitC * M[C6H8O6]

This is consistent with the anticipated result.
<h3>Example 4.9: Number of Product Molecules Generated by a Reaction</h3>

<h4>Number of Product Molecules Generated by a Reaction</h4>

How many carbon dioxide molecules are produced when 0.75 mol of propane is combusted according to this equation?

!C3H8 +5O2 -> 3CO2 +4H2O

<h4>Solution</h4>

n[C3H8] = 0.75 mol

The approach here is the same as for <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/4-3-reaction-stoichiometry/#fs-idp48900096">Example 7</a>, though the absolute number of molecules is requested, not the number of moles of molecules. This will simply require use of Avogadro’s constant relating chemical amount and number of molecules.

The balanced equation shows that carbon dioxide is produced from propane in a 3:1 ratio:

@ n[CO2] / n[C3H8] = 3/1

Using this stoichiometric factor, the provided molar amount of propane, and Avogadro’s number,

n[CO2] = (1/3) n[C3H8]

N_A = 6.022E23 mol^-1

N[CO2 molecules] = N_A * n[CO2]

<h3>Example 3.20: Volume of a Diluted Solution</h3>

What volume of 0.12 M HBr can be prepared from 11 mL (0.011 L) of 0.45 M HBr?

<h4>Solution</h4>

We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and c1, and the concentration of the resultant diluted solution, c2. We need to find the volume of the diluted solution, V2. 

c1 = 0.45 M

V1 = 0.011 L

c2 = 0.12 M

V2 = ?

Since the diluted concentration (0.12 M) is slightly more than one-fourth the original concentration (0.45 M), we would expect the volume of the diluted solution to be roughly four times the original volume, or around 44 mL. 

To calculate the actual volume, we rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate V2.

@c1 V1 = c2 V2

Solving for the unknown volume yields:

V2 = V1 (c1/c2)

The volume of the 0.12 M solution is 0.041 L (41 mL). The result is reasonable and compares well with our rough estimate.
<h3>Example 3.21: Volume of a Concentrated Solution Needed for Dilution</h3>

What volume of 1.59 M KOH is required to prepare 5.00 L of 0.100 M KOH?

<h4>Solution</h4>

We are given the concentration of a stock solution, c1, and the volume and concentration of the resultant diluted solution, V2 and c2. We need to find the volume of the stock solution, V1. 

c1 = 1.59 M

c2 = 0.100 M

V2= 5.00 L

V1 = ?

Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 M is roughly one-sixteenth that of the stock solution (1.59 M), we would expect the volume of the stock solution to be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution, or around 0.3 liters. 

To obtain the accurate volume, we rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate V1:

@ c1 V1 = c2 V2

V1 = V2 (c2 / c1)

Thus, we would need 0.314 L of the 1.59 M solution to prepare the desired solution. This result is consistent with our rough estimate.
<h3>Example 4.1: Balancing Chemical Equations</h3>

Write a balanced equation for the reaction of molecular nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) to form dinitrogen pentoxide.

<h4>Solution</h4>

First, write the unbalanced equation.

!N2 +O2 -> N2O5 !unbalanced

Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation.

@atoms_N_left = 2

@atoms_N_right = 2

@atoms_O_left = 2

@atoms_O_right = 5

Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number of oxygen atoms. To balance the number of oxygen atoms, a reasonable first attempt would be to change the coefficients for the O2 and N2O5 to integers that will yield 10 O atoms (the least common multiple for the O atom subscripts in these two formulas).

!N2 +5O2 -> 2N2O5

@atoms_N_left = 2

@atoms_N_right = 2 * 2

@atoms_O_left = 5 * 2

@atoms_O_right = 2 * 5

The N atom balance has been upset by this change; it is restored by changing the coefficient for the reactant N2 to 2.

!2N2 +5O2 -> 2N2O5 !balanced

@atomsN_left = 2 * 2

@atomsN_right = 2 * 2

@atomsO_left = 5 * 2

@atomsO_right = 2 * 5

The numbers of N and O atoms on either side of the equation are now equal, and so the equation is balanced.
<h3>Example 4.2: Molecular and Ionic Equations</h3>

When carbon dioxide is dissolved in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, the mixture reacts to yield aqueous sodium carbonate and liquid water. Write balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations for this process.

<h4>Solution</h4>

Begin by identifying formulas for the reactants and products and arranging them properly in chemical equation form:

!CO2(aq) +NaOH(aq) -> Na2CO3(aq) +H2O(l) !(unbalanced)

Balance is achieved easily in this case by changing the coefficient for NaOH to 2, resulting in the molecular equation for this reaction:

!CO2(aq) +2NaOH(aq) -> Na2CO3(aq) +H2O(l) ! balanced

The two dissolved ionic compounds, NaOH and Na2CO3, can be represented as dissociated ions to yield the complete ionic equation:

!CO2(aq) +2Na+ (aq) +2OH- (aq) -> 2Na+ (aq) +CO3^2- (aq) +H2O(l) ! Complete ionic

Finally, identify the spectator ion(s), in this case Na+(aq), and remove it from each side of the equation to generate the net ionic equation:

!CO2(aq) +2OH-(aq) -> CO3^2-(aq) +H2O(l) ! Net ionic
<h3>Example 4.3: Predicting Precipitation Reactions</h3>

Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the reaction.

(a) potassium sulfate and barium nitrate

(b) lithium chloride and silver acetate

(c) lead nitrate and ammonium carbonate

<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) The two possible products for this combination are KNO3 and BaSO4. The solubility guidelines indicate BaSO4 is insoluble, and so a precipitation reaction is expected. The net ionic equation for this reaction, derived in the manner detailed in the previous module, is

!Ba^2+(aq) +SO4^2-(aq) -> BaSO4(s)

(b) The two possible products for this combination are LiC2H3O2 and AgCl. The solubility guidelines indicate AgCl is insoluble, and so a precipitation reaction is expected. The net ionic equation for this reaction, derived in the manner detailed in the previous module, is

!Ag+(aq) +Cl-(aq) -> AgCl(s)

(c) The two possible products for this combination are PbCO3 and NH4NO3. The solubility guidelines indicate PbCO3 is insoluble, and so a precipitation reaction is expected. The net ionic equation for this reaction, derived in the manner detailed in the previous module, is

!Pb^2+(aq) +CO3^2-(aq) -> PbCO3(s)
<h3>Example 4.4: Writing Equations for Acid-Base Reactions</h3>

Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reactions described here:

(a) the weak acid hydrogen hypochlorite reacts with water

(b) a solution of barium hydroxide is neutralized with a solution of nitric acid

<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) The two reactants are provided, HOCl and H2O. Since the substance is reported to be an acid, its reaction with water will involve the transfer of H+ from HOCl to H2O to generate hydronium ions, H3O+ and hypochlorite ions, OCl-.

!HOCl(aq) +H2O(l) <=> OCl-(aq) +H3O+(aq)

A double-arrow is appropriate in this equation because it indicates the HOCl is a weak acid that has not reacted completely.

(b) The two reactants are provided, Ba(OH)2 and HNO3. Since this is a neutralization reaction, the two products will be water and a salt composed of the cation of the ionic hydroxide (Ba^2+) and the anion generated when the acid transfers its hydrogen ion (NO3- ).

!Ba(OH)2(aq) +2HNO3(aq) -> Ba(NO3)2(aq) +2H2O(l)
<h3>Example 4.5: Assigning Oxidation Numbers</h3>

Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all the elements in the following species:

(a) H2S

(b) SO3^2-

(c) Na2SO4

<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) According to guideline 1, the oxidation number for H is +1.

Using this oxidation number and the compound’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the oxidation number for sulfur:

@charge[H2S] = 0 = (2 *  +1) + (1 * ON[S])

@ON[S] = 0 - (2 * +1) = -2

(b) Guideline 3 suggests the oxidation number for oxygen is -2.

Using this oxidation number and the ion’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the oxidation number for sulfur:

@charge[SO3^2-] = -2 = (3 * -2)+(1 * ON[S])

@ON[S] = -2-(3×-2)=+4

(c) For ionic compounds, it’s convenient to assign oxidation numbers for the cation and anion separately.

According to guideline 2, the oxidation number for sodium is +1.

Assuming the usual oxidation number for oxygen (-2 per guideline 3), the oxidation number for sulfur is calculated as directed by guideline 4:

@charge[SO4^2-] = -2 = (4 * -2)+(1 * ON[S])

@ON[S] = -2 - (4 * -2) = +6
<h3>Example 4.6: Describing Redox Reactions</h3>

Redox reactions are identified per definition if one or more elements undergo a change in oxidation number.

(a) This is not a redox reaction, since oxidation numbers remain unchanged for all elements.

Oxygen is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from -1 in H2O2(aq) to 0 in O2(g). Oxygen is also reduced, its oxidation number decreasing from -1 in H2O2(aq) to -2 in H2O(l). For disproportionation reactions, the same substance functions as an oxidant and a reductant.

Each half-reaction will contain one reactant and one product with one element in common.
!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+
!Cr2O7^2- -> Cr^3+
Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen. The iron half-reaction is already balanced, but the chromium half-reaction shows two Cr atoms on the left and one Cr atom on the right. Changing the coefficient on the right side of the equation to 2 achieves balance with regard to Cr atoms.
!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+
!Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+
Balance oxygen atoms by adding H2O molecules. The iron half-reaction does not contain O atoms. The chromium half-reaction shows seven O atoms on the left and none on the right, so seven water molecules are added to the right side.
!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+
!Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O
Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H^ +ions. The iron half-reaction does not contain H atoms. The chromium half-reaction shows 14 H atoms on the right and none on the left, so 14 hydrogen ions are added to the left side.
!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+
!Cr2O7^2- +14H+ -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O
Balance charge by adding electrons. The iron half-reaction shows a total charge of 2 + on the left side (1 Fe^2+ ion) and 3 + on the right side (1 Fe^3+ ion). Adding one electron to the right side bring that side’s total charge to (3+)  + (1-) = 2+, and charge balance is achieved.
The chromium half-reaction shows a total charge of (1 × 2-)  + (14 × 1 +) = 12 + on the left side (1 Cr2O7^2- ion and 14 H+ ions). The total charge on the right side is (2 × 3 +) = 6  + (2 Cr^3+ ions). Adding six electrons to the left side will bring that side’s total charge to (12 +  + 6-) = 6 +, and charge balance is achieved.
!Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+ +e-
!Cr2O7^2- +14H+ +6e- -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O
Multiply the two half-reactions so the number of electrons in one reaction equals the number of electrons in the other reaction. To be consistent with mass conservation, and the idea that redox reactions involve the transfer (not creation or destruction) of electrons, the iron half-reaction’s coefficient must be multiplied by 6.
!6Fe^2+ -> 6Fe^3+ +6e-
!Cr2O7^2- +6e- +14H+ -> 2Cr^3+ +7H2O
Add the balanced half-reactions and cancel species that appear on both sides of the equation.
!6Fe^2+ +Cr2O7^2- +6e- +14H+ -> 6Fe^3+ +6e- +2Cr^3+ +7H2O
Only the six electrons are redundant species. Removing them from each side of the equation yields the simplified, balanced equation here:
!6Fe^2+ +Cr2O7^2- +14H+ -> 6Fe^3+ +2Cr^3+ +7H2O
A final check of atom and charge balance confirms the equation is balanced.
@Fe_reactant = Fe_product = 6
@Cr_reactant = Cr_product = 2
@O_reactant = O_product = 7
@H_reactant = H_product = 14
@Charge_reactant = Charge_product = 24

<h4>Solution</h4>

Referring to the balanced chemical equation, the stoichiometric factors relating the two substances of interest are
ν[I2] = 3
ν[Al] = 2
@ n[I2] / n[Al] = (ν[I2]/ν[Al])

@n[I2] = (ν[I2]/ν[Al]) n[Al]

n[Al] = 0.429 mol

n[I2] = (ν[I2]/ν[Al]) n[Al]

<h4>Solution</h4>

<h3>Example 4.12: Identifying the Limiting Reactant</h3>

<h4>Identifying the Limiting Reactant</h4>

Silicon nitride is a very hard, high-temperature-resistant ceramic used as a component of turbine blades in jet engines. It is prepared according to the following equation:

!3Si(s) +2N2(g) -> Si3N4(s)

Which is the limiting reactant when 2.00 g of Si and 1.50 g of N2 react?

<h4>Solution</h4>

Compute the provided chemical amounts of reactants, and then compare these amounts to the balanced equation to identify the limiting reactant.

m[Si] = 2.00 g

m[N2] = 1.50 g

n[Si] = m[Si] / M[Si]

n[N2] = m[N2] / M[N2]

n[->] = min(n[Si] / 3, n[N2] / 2)

Comparing the ratios of chemical amount to stoichiometric coefficient shows that Si is limiting (smaller number, runs out while N2 is left over).

To check our results, we calculate how much is left over.

n[Si]leftover = n[Si] - n[->] * 3

n[N2]leftover = n[N2] - n[->] * 2

These chemical amounts should either be zero (for the limiting reactant) or larger than zero (for the reactants in excess). If we obtain any negative chemical amounts, we know there was a mistake in the setup or in the calculation.
<h3>Example 4.13: Calculation of Percent Yield</h3>

<h4>Calculation of Percent Yield</h4>

Upon reaction of 1.274 g of copper sulfate with excess zinc metal, 0.392 g copper metal was obtained according to the equation:

!CuSO4(aq) +Zn(s) -> Cu(s) +ZnSO4(aq)

What is the relative yield expressed in percent?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m[CuSO4] = 1.274 g

m[Cu(s)] = 0.392 g

@ n[Cu(s)]theo / n[CuSO4] = (1/1)

The provided information identifies copper sulfate as the limiting reactant, and so the theoretical yield is found by the approach illustrated in the previous module, as shown here:

n[CuSO4] = m[CuSO4] /  M[CuSO4]

n[Cu(s)]actual = m[Cu(s)] / M[Cu]

n[Cu(s)]theo = (1/1) n[CuSO4]

Using this theoretical yield and the provided value for actual yield, the percent yield is calculated to be

yield_rel = n[Cu(s)]actual / n[Cu(s)]theo * 100 ％


<h3>Example 4.14: Titration Analysis</h3>

<h4>Titration Analysis</h4>

The end point in a titration of a 50.00 mL sample of aqueous HCl was reached by addition of 35.23 mL of 0.250 M NaOH titrant. The titration reaction is:

!HCl(aq) +NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) +H2O(l)

What is the concentration of the HCl?

<h4>Solution</h4>

V[HCl] = 50.00 mL

c[HCl] = ?

c[NaOH] = 0.250 M

V[NaOH] = 35.23 mL

At the end point of the titration, the reactants are present at stochiometric ratio

@n[HCl] / n[NaOH] = 1/1

As for all reaction stoichiometry calculations, the key issue is the relation between the chemical amounts of the chemical species of interest as depicted in the balanced chemical equation. The approach outlined in previous modules of this chapter is followed, with additional considerations required, since the amounts of reactants provided and requested are expressed as solution concentrations.

For this exercise, the calculation will follow the following outlined steps:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_04_05_map7_img.jpg", width="50%"}

n[NaOH] = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]

n[HCl] = n[NaOH] * (1/1)

c[HCl] = n[HCl] / V[HCl]
<h3>Example 4.15: Gravimetric Analysis</h3>

<h4>Gravimetric Analysis</h4>

A 0.4550 g solid mixture containing MgSO4 is dissolved in water and treated with an excess of Ba(NO3)2, resulting in the precipitation of 0.6168 g of BaSO4.

!MgSO4(aq) +Ba(NO3)2(aq) -> BaSO4(s) +Mg(NO3)2(aq)

What is the mass ratio (percent) of MgSO4 in the mixture?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_mix = 0.4550 g

m[BaSO4] = 0.6168 g

The plan for this calculation is similar to others used in stoichiometric calculations, the central step being the connection between the moles of BaSO4 and MgSO4 through their stoichiometric factor. Once the mass of MgSO4 is computed, it may be used along with the mass of the sample mixture to calculate the requested percentage concentration.

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_04_05_map8_img.jpg", width="40%"}

n[BaSO4] = m[BaSO4] / M[BaSO4]

@ n[BaSO4] / n[MgSO4] = 1/1

n[MgSO4] = n[BaSO4]

The mass of MgSO4 that would yield the provided precipitate mass is

m[MgSO4] = n[MgSO4] * M[MgSO4]

The concentration of MgSO4 in the sample mixture is then calculated to be

ratio_mass[MgSO4] = m[MgSO4] / m_mix * 100 ％


<h3>Example 4.16: Combustion Analysis</h3>

<h4>Combustion Analysis</h4>

Polyethylene is a hydrocarbon polymer used to produce food-storage bags and many other flexible plastic items. A combustion analysis of a 0.00126 g sample of polyethylene yields 0.00394 g of CO2 and 0.00161 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of polyethylene?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_PE = 0.00126 g

m[CO2] = 0.00394 g

m[H2O] = 0.00161 g

The primary assumption in this exercise is that all the carbon in the sample combusted is converted to carbon dioxide, and all the hydrogen in the sample is converted to water:

!CxHy(s) +excess O2(g) -> xCO2(g) + y/2 H2O(g)

Note that a balanced equation is not necessary for the task at hand. To derive the empirical formula of the compound, only the subscripts x and y are needed.

First, calculate the chemical amounts of carbon and hydrogen in the sample, using the provided masses of the carbon dioxide and water, respectively. With these chemical amounts, the empirical formula for the compound may be written as described in the previous chapter of this text. An outline of this approach is given in the following flow chart:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_04_05_combmap_img.jpg"}

n[CO2] = m[CO2] / M[CO2]

n[H2O] = m[H2O] / M[H2O]

n[C]inPE = n[CO2]

n[H]inPE = n[H2O] * 2

The empirical formula for the compound is then derived by identifying the smallest whole-number multiples for these molar amounts. The H-to-C molar ratio is

ratio_HtoC = n[H]inPE / n[C]inPE

and the empirical formula for polyethylene is CH2.
<h3>Example 3.8: Deriving the Number of Atoms and Molecules from the Mass of a Compound</h3>

A packet of an artificial sweetener contains 40.0 mg of saccharin (C7H5NO3S), which has the structural formula:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_saccharin_img.jpg"}

Given that saccharin has a molar mass of 183.18 g/mol, how many saccharin molecules are in a 40.0-mg (0.0400-g) sample of saccharin? How many carbon atoms are in the same sample?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_saccharin = 0.0400 g

M_saccharin = 183.18 g/mol

The number of molecules in a given mass of compound is computed by first deriving the number of moles, as demonstrated in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/3-1-formula-mass-and-the-mole-concept/#fs-idm1714048">Example 5</a>, and then multiplying by Avogadro’s constant:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_sacch_img.jpg"}

@ N_ = n * N_A

N_A = 6.022e23 /mol

Using the provided mass and molar mass for saccharin yields:

n_sacharin = m_saccharin / M_saccharin

N_saccharin = n_sacharin * N_A

The compound’s formula shows that each molecule contains seven carbon atoms, and so the number of C atoms in the provided sample is:

N_carbon_atoms = 7 N_saccharin
<h3>Example 3.9: Calculation of Percent Composition</h3>

Analysis of a 12.04-g sample of a liquid compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen showed it to contain 7.34 g C, 1.85 g H, and 2.85 g N. What is the percent composition of this compound?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_liquid = 12.04 g

m_C = 7.34 g

m_H = 1.85 g

m_N = 2.85 g

We divide the experimentally derived mass of each element by the overall mass of the compound to get the fraction of each element - by mass - in the compound.

f_C = m_C / m_liquid * 100 ％

f_H = m_H / m_liquid * 100 ％

f_N = m_N / m_liquid * 100 ％

The analysis results indicate that the compound is 61.0% C, 15.4% H, and 23.7% N by mass.
<h3>Example 3.10: Determining Percent Composition from a Molecular Formula</h3>

Aspirin is a compound with the molecular formula C9H8O4. What is its percent composition?

<h4>Solution</h4>

To calculate the percent composition, we need to know the masses of C, H, and O in a known mass of C9H8O4. It is convenient to consider 1 mol of C9H8O4 and use its molar mass (180.159 g/mole, determined from the chemical formula) to calculate the percentages of each of its elements:

n[C9H8O4] = 1 mol

The chemical amounts of the atoms making up the molecule follow from the chemical formula

n[C] = 9 n[C9H8O4]

n[H] = 8 n[C9H8O4]

n[O] = 4 n[C9H8O4]

Now you can calculate all the masses

m[C9H8O4] = n[C9H8O4] M[C9H8O4]

m[C] = n[C] M[C]

m[H] = n[H] M[H]

m[O] = n[O] M[O]  

To calculate the fraction of a given element in the compound - by mass - we divide by the mass of the compound

f_C = m[C] /m[C9H8O4]  * 100 ％

f_H = m[H] /m[C9H8O4] * 100 ％ 

f_O = m[O] /m[C9H8O4] * 100 ％

The percent composition is 60.002% carbon, 4.476% hydrogen and 35.522%. Note that these percentages sum to equal 100.00% when appropriately rounded.

<hr>It is also possible to skip calculating masses and simply divide the molar mass of the element by the molar mass of the compound and multiply with the number of times the atom occurs in the compound. For carbon, for example, we would calculate:

f[C] = M[C] / M[C9H8O4] * 9
<h3>Example 7.1: Determining the Electronic Structures of Cations</h3>

There are at least 14 elements categorized as “essential trace elements” for the human body. They are called “essential” because they are required for healthy bodily functions, “trace” because they are required only in small amounts, and “elements” in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two of these essential trace elements, chromium and zinc, are required as Cr^3+ and Zn^2+. Write the electron configurations of these cations.

<h4>Solution</h4>

First, write the electron configuration for the neutral atoms:

!Zn: [Ar] 3d^10 4s^2

!Cr: [Ar] 3d^5 4s^1

Next, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition metals, electrons are removed from the s orbital first and then from the d orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from the p orbitals and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have a charge of 2+, and thus loses only the two electrons in its s orbital. Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s electrons and then its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron configurations of the ions:

!Zn^2+: [Ar] 3d^10

!Cr^3+: [Ar] 3d^3
<h3>Example 3.2: Computing Formula Mass for an Ionic Compound</h3>

The formula for this compound indicates it contains Al^3+ and SO4^2- ions combined in a 2:3 ratio.

<h3>Example 7.3: Electronegativity and Bond Polarity</h3>

Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of proteins. Using the electronegativity values in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_02_ENTable.jpg">Figure 6</a>, arrange the following covalent bonds — all commonly found in amino acids — in order of increasing polarity. Then designate the positive and negative atoms using the symbols δ+ and δ–:

C–H, C–N, C–O, N–H, O–H, S–H

<h4>Solution</h4>

The polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the electronegativity difference increases. The atom with the δ– designation is the more electronegative of the two. <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/7-2-covalent-bonding/#fs-idm2614240">Table 1</a> shows these bonds in order of increasing polarity.

<h4>Solution</h4>

Calculate the number of valence electrons.

VE[HCN] =  (1 * 1) + (1 * 4) + (1 * 5)

VE[H3CCH3] = (3 * 1) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 1)

VE[HCCH] = (1 * 1) + (2 * 4) + (1 * 1)

VE[NH3] = (1 * 5) + (1 * 3)

Draw a skeleton and connect the atoms with single bonds. Remember that H is never a central atom:

Where needed, distribute electrons to the terminal atoms (don't use more electrons than available, though):

Xenon is a noble gas, but it forms a number of stable compounds. We examined XeF4 earlier. What are the Lewis structures of XeF2 and XeF6?

<h4>Solution</h4>

We can draw the Lewis structure of any covalent molecule by following the six steps discussed earlier. In this case, we can condense the last few steps, since not all of them apply.

Calculate the number of valence electrons:

VE[XeF2] = 8 + (2 * 7)

VE[XeF6] = 8 + (6 * 7)

Draw a skeleton joining the atoms by single bonds. Xenon will be the central atom because fluorine cannot be a central atom:

Distribute the remaining electrons.

<br>

XeF2: We place three lone pairs of electrons around each F atom, accounting for 12 electrons and giving each F atom 8 electrons. Thus, six electrons (three lone pairs) remain. These lone pairs must be placed on the Xe atom. This is acceptable because Xe atoms have empty valence shell d orbitals and can accommodate more than eight electrons. The Lewis structure of XeF2 shows two bonding pairs and three lone pairs of electrons around the Xe atom:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_03_XeF2_img.jpg", width="20%"}

XeF6: We place three lone pairs of electrons around each F atom, accounting for 36 electrons. Two electrons remain, and this lone pair is placed on the Xe atom:

<h3>Example 7.6: Calculating Formal Charge from Lewis Structures</h3>

Assign formal charges to each atom in the interhalogen ion ICl4-.

<h4>Solution</h4>

We divide the bonding electron pairs equally for all I–Cl bonds:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_04_ICL4_img.jpg"}

We assign lone pairs of electrons to their atoms. Each Cl atom now has seven electrons assigned to it, and the I atom has eight.

Subtract this number from the number of valence electrons for the neutral atom:

FC[I] =  7 - 8

FC[Cl] = 7 - 7

The sum of the formal charges of all the atoms equals -1, which is identical to the charge of the ion (-1).
<h3>Example 7.7: Calculating Formal Charge from Lewis Structures</h3>

Assign formal charges to each atom in the interhalogen molecule BrCl3.

<h4>Solution</h4>

Assign one of the electrons in each Br–Cl bond to the Br atom and one to the Cl atom in that bond:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_04_BRCL3_img.jpg"}

Assign the lone pairs to their atom. Now each Cl atom has seven electrons and the Br atom has seven electrons.

Subtract this number from the number of valence electrons for the neutral atom. This gives the formal charge:

FC[Br] = 7 - 7

FC[Cl] = 7 - 7

All atoms in BrCl3 have a formal charge of zero, and the sum of the formal charges totals zero, as it must in a neutral molecule.
<h3>Example 7.8: Using Formal Charge to Determine Molecular Structure</h3>

Nitrous oxide, N2O, commonly known as laughing gas, is used as an anesthetic in minor surgeries, such as the routine extraction of wisdom teeth. Which is the likely structure for nitrous oxide?

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_04_N2O_img.jpg"}

<h4>Solution</h4>

Determining formal charge yields the following:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_04_N2Ofc_img.jpg"}

The structure with a terminal oxygen atom best satisfies the criteria for the most stable distribution of formal charge:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_04_NNO_img.jpg"}

The number of atoms with formal charges are minimized (Guideline 2), and there is no formal charge larger than one (Guideline 2). This is again consistent with the preference for having the less electronegative atom in the central position.
<h3>Example 7.9: Using Bond Energies to Calculate Approximate Enthalpy Changes</h3>

Methanol, CH3OH, may be an excellent alternative fuel. The high-temperature reaction of steam and carbon produces a mixture of the gases carbon monoxide, CO, and hydrogen, H2, from which methanol can be produced. Using the bond energies in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/7-5-strengths-of-ionic-and-covalent-bonds/#fs-idm44464336">Table 4</a>, calculate the approximate enthalpy change, ΔH, for the reaction here:

!CO(g) +2H2(g) -> CH3OH(g)

<h4>Solution</h4>First, we need to write the Lewis structures of the reactants and the products:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_05_CH3OHLew_img.jpg"}

From this, we see that ΔH for this reaction involves the energy required to break a C–O triple bond and two H–H single bonds, as well as the energy produced by the formation of three C–H single bonds, a C–O single bond, and an O–H single bond. We can express this as follows:

@ ΔH = sum(D_bonds_broken) - sum(D_bonds_formed)

@ ΔH = sum(D[C#O], 2 D[H-H]) - sum(3 D[C-H], D[C-O], D[O-H])

Using the bond energy values in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/7-5-strengths-of-ionic-and-covalent-bonds/#fs-idm44464336">Table 4</a>, we obtain:

D[C#O] = 1080 kJ/mol

D[H-H] = 436 kJ/mol

D[C-H] = 415 kJ/mol

D[C-O] = 350 kJ/mol

D[O-H] = 464 kJ/mol

ΔH_estimate = sum(D[C#O], 2 D[H-H]) - sum(3 D[C-H], D[C-O], D[O-H])

We can compare this value to the value calculated based on ΔHf° data from Appendix G:

ΔHf°[CH3OH(g)] = -201.0 kJ/mol

ΔHf°[CO(g)] = -110.52 kJ/mol

ΔHf°[H2] = 0

ΔH_measurement = ΔHf°[CH3OH(g)] - ΔHf°[CO(g)] - 2 ΔHf°[H2]

Note that there is a fairly significant gap between the values calculated using the two different methods. This occurs because D values are the average of different bond strengths; therefore, they often give only rough agreement with other data.
<h3>Example 7.10: Lattice Energy Comparisons</h3>

The precious gem ruby is aluminum oxide, Al2O3, containing traces of Cr^3+. The compound Al2Se3 is used in the fabrication of some semiconductor devices. Which has the larger lattice energy, Al2O3 or Al2Se3?

<h4>Solution</h4>

In these two ionic compounds, the charges Z<sup>+</sup> and Z<sup>-</sup> are the same, so the difference in lattice energy will depend upon R0. The O^2– ion is smaller than the Se^2– ion. Thus, Al2O3 would have a shorter interionic distance than Al2Se3, and Al2O3 would have the larger lattice energy.
<h3>Example 7.11: Predicting Electron-pair Geometry and Molecular Structure: CO2 and BCl3</h3>

Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for each of the following:

(a) carbon dioxide, CO2, a molecule produced by the combustion of fossil fuels

(b) boron trichloride, BCl3, an important industrial chemical

<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) We write the Lewis structure of CO2 as:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_CO2_img.jpg"}

This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atom—each double bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of 180°. The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are linear.

<br>

(b) We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_BCl3_img.jpg"}

Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The B–Cl bonds lie in a plane with 120° angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular structure (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_BCl3mol.jpg">Figure 21</a>).

<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_BCl3mol.jpg">

The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of BCl3 are both trigonal planar. Note that the VSEPR geometry indicates the correct bond angles (120°), unlike the Lewis structure shown above.
<h3>Example 7.12: Predicting Electron-pair Geometry and Molecular Structure: Ammonium</h3>

Two of the top 50 chemicals produced in the United States, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, both used as fertilizers, contain the ammonium ion. Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of the NH4+ cation.

<h4>Solution</h4>

We write the Lewis structure of NH4+ as:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_NH4_img.jpg"}

We can see that NH4+ contains four bonds from the nitrogen atom to hydrogen atoms and no lone pairs. We expect the four regions of high electron density to arrange themselves so that they point to the corners of a tetrahedron with the central nitrogen atom in the middle (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom.jpg">Figure 19</a>). Therefore, the electron pair geometry of NH4+ is tetrahedral, and the molecular structure is also tetrahedral (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_NH4mol.jpg">Figure 22</a>).

<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_NH4mol.jpg">
<h3>Example 7.13: Predicting Electron-pair Geometry and Molecular Structure: Lone Pairs on the Central Atom</h3>

Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of a water molecule.

<h4>Solution</h4>

The Lewis structure of H2O indicates that there are four regions of high electron density around the oxygen atom: two lone pairs and two chemical bonds:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_H2O_img.jpg"}

We predict that these four regions are arranged in a tetrahedral fashion (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_H2Omol.jpg">Figure 23</a>), as indicated in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom.jpg">Figure 19</a>. Thus, the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral and the molecular structure is bent with an angle slightly less than 109.5°. In fact, the bond angle is 104.5°.

<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_H2Omol.jpg", width="30%">
<h3>Example 7.14: Predicting Electron-pair Geometry and Molecular Structure: SF4</h3>

Sulfur tetrafluoride, SF4, is extremely valuable for the preparation of fluorine-containing compounds used as herbicides (i.e., SF4 is used as a fluorinating agent). Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of a SF4 molecule.

<h4>Solution</h4>

The Lewis structure of SF4 indicates five regions of electron density around the sulfur atom: one lone pair and four bonding pairs:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_SF4_img.jpg"}

We expect these five regions to adopt a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry. To minimize lone pair repulsions, the lone pair occupies one of the equatorial positions. The molecular structure is that of a seesaw (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom.jpg">Figure 19</a>).

<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_SF4mol.jpg">Figure 24(a): SF4 has a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement of the five regions of electron density. (b) One of the regions is a lone pair, which results in a seesaw-shaped molecular structure.
<h3>Example 7.15: Predicting Electron-pair Geometry and Molecular Structure: XeF4</h3>

Of all the noble gases, xenon is the most reactive, frequently reacting with elements such as oxygen and fluorine. Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of the XeF4 molecule.

<h4>Solution</h4>

The Lewis structure of XeF4 indicates six regions of high electron density around the xenon atom: two lone pairs and four bonds:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_XeF4_img.jpg"}

These six regions adopt an octahedral arrangement (panel A below), which is the electron-pair geometry. To minimize repulsions, the lone pairs should be on opposite sides of the central atom. The five atoms are all in the same plane and have a square planar molecular structure (panel B below).

<h3>Example 7.16: Predicting Structure in Multicenter Molecules</h3>

The Lewis structure for the simplest amino acid, glycine, H2NCH2CO2H, is shown here. Predict the local geometry for the nitrogen atom, the two carbon atoms, and the oxygen atom with a hydrogen atom attached:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_gly_img.jpg"}

<h4>Solution</h4>

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_gly3D_img.jpg"}

Consider each central atom independently. The electron-pair geometries:

nitrogen––four regions of electron density; tetrahedral

carbon (CH2)––four regions of electron density; tetrahedral

carbon (CO2)—three regions of electron density; trigonal planar

oxygen (OH)—four regions of electron density; tetrahedral

<br>

The local structures:

nitrogen––three bonds, one lone pair; trigonal pyramidal

carbon (CH2)—four bonds, no lone pairs; tetrahedral

carbon (CO2)—three bonds (double bond counts as one bond), no lone pairs; trigonal planar

oxygen (OH)—two bonds, two lone pairs; bent (109°)
<h3>Example 7.17: Molecular Simulation</h3>

Using <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16MolecShape">molecular shape simulator</a> allows us to control whether bond angles and/or lone pairs are displayed by checking or unchecking the boxes under “Options” on the right. We can also use the “Name” checkboxes at bottom-left to display or hide the electron pair geometry (called “electron geometry” in the simulator) and/or molecular structure (called “molecular shape” in the simulator).

Build the molecule HCN in the simulator based on the following Lewis structure:

H–C≡N

Click on each bond type or lone pair at right to add that group to the central atom. Once you have the complete molecule, rotate it to examine the predicted molecular structure. What molecular structure is this?

<h4>Solution</h4>

The molecular structure is linear.
<h3>Example 7.18: Polarity Simulations</h3>

Open the <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16MolecPolarity">molecule polarity simulation</a> and select the “Three Atoms” tab at the top. This should display a molecule ABC with three electronegativity adjustors. You can display or hide the bond moments, molecular dipoles, and partial charges at the right. Turning on the Electric Field will show whether the molecule moves when exposed to a field, similar to <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_07_06_Dipolfield.jpg">Figure 28</a>.

Use the electronegativity controls to determine how the molecular dipole will look for the starting bent molecule if:

(a) A and C are very electronegative and B is in the middle of the range.

(b) A is very electronegative, and B and C are not.

<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) Molecular dipole moment points immediately between A and C.

(b) Molecular dipole moment points along the A–B bond, toward A.

<h3>Example 3.8: Deriving the Number of Atoms and Molecules from the Mass of a Compound</h3>

A packet of an artificial sweetener contains 40.0 mg of saccharin (C7H5NO3S), which has the structural formula:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_saccharin_img.jpg", width="20%"}

Given that saccharin has a molar mass of 183.18 g/mol, how many saccharin molecules are in a 40.0-mg (0.0400-g) sample of saccharin? How many carbon atoms are in the same sample?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_packet = 40.0 mg

M[C7H5NO3S] = 183.18 g/mol

N_molecules = ?

N_C_atoms = ?

The number of molecules in a given mass of compound is computed by first deriving the number of moles, as demonstrated in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/3-1-formula-mass-and-the-mole-concept/#fs-idm1714048">Example 5</a>, and then multiplying by Avogadro’s constant:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_02_sacch_img.jpg", width="50%"}

@N_molecules = m_sample / M_compound * N_A

N_A = 6.022e23 /mol

Using the provided mass and molar mass for saccharin yields:

N_molecules = m_packet / M[C7H5NNO3S] * N_A

The compound’s formula shows that each molecule contains seven carbon atoms, and so the number of C atoms in the provided sample is:

N_C_atoms = 7 N_molecules
<h3>Example 3.9: Calculation of Percent Composition</h3>

Analysis of a 12.04-g sample of a liquid compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen showed it to contain 7.34 g C, 1.85 g H, and 2.85 g N. What is the percent composition of this compound?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_sample = 12.04 g

m_C = 7.34 g

m_H = 1.85 g

m_N = 2.85 g

We are looking for the fraction by mass of these elements in the compound.

f_C = ?

f_H = ?

f_N = ?

To calculate percent composition, we divide the experimentally derived mass of each element by the overall mass of the compound, and then convert to a percentage:
f_C = m_C /m_sample  * 100 ％

f_H = m_H /m_sample  * 100 ％

f_N = m_N /m_sample * 100 ％
The analysis results indicate that the compound is 61.0% C, 15.4% H, and 23.7% N by mass.
<h3>Example 3.11: Determining a Compound’s Empirical Formula from the Masses of Its Elements</h3>

A sample of the black mineral hematite (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_03_hematite.jpg">Figure 12</a>), an oxide of iron found in many iron ores, contains 34.97 g of iron and 15.03 g of oxygen. What is the empirical formula of hematite?

<h4>Solution</h4>

For this problem, we are given the mass in grams of each element.

m[Fe] = 34.97 g

m[O] = 15.03 g

ratio_molar = ?

Begin by finding the chemical amount of each:
n[Fe] =m[Fe] /M[Fe] 

n[O] =m[O] /M[O] 

There is less iron than oxygen, so calculate the oxygen-to-iron molar ratio:

ratio[O:Fe] = n[O] / n[Fe]

The ratio is of iron to oxygen is 1 : 1.500, so the formula is

! FeO_{1.5}

Finally, multiply all coefficients by two to get the smallest possible whole number subscripts while still maintaining the correct iron-to-oxygen ratio:

! Fe2O3! empirical formula

The empirical formula is Fe2O3.
<h3>Example 3.12: Determining an Empirical Formula from Percent Composition</h3>

The bacterial fermentation of grain to produce ethanol forms a gas with a percent composition of 27.29% C and 72.71% O (Figure 3). What is the empirical formula for this gas?<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_03_BrewTank.jpg", width="30%">Figure 13: An oxide of carbon is removed from these fermentation tanks through the large copper pipes at the top. (credit: “Dual Freq”/Wikimedia Commons)

<h4>Solution</h4>

f_C = 27.29 ％

f_O = 72.71 ％

ratio_molar = ?

Since the scale for percentages is 100, it is most convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in a sample weighing 100 g. (The calculation is “most convenient” because if a compound contains 27.29% carbon by mass, a 100-g sample will contain 27.29 g of carbon, and so on for the other elements. This makes it easier to follow the calculation in your head, but you would get the same answer for any mass you decide to start with because in the end, this mass cancels out.)

m_total = 100 g

m_C = f_C * m_total

m_O = f_O * m_total

To get the molar ratio, we have to calculate the chemical amounts of carbon and oxygen present.
n_C =m_C /M[C]

n_O =m_O /M[O]
Coefficients for the tentative empirical formula are derived by dividing each molar amount by the lesser of the two:

coeff_C = n_C / min(n_C ,n_O )

coeff_O = n_O / min(n_C ,n_O )

Since the resulting ratio is one carbon to two oxygen atoms, the empirical formula is CO2.
<h3>Example 3.13: Determination of the Molecular Formula for Nicotine</h3>

Nicotine, an alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants that is mainly responsible for the addictive nature of cigarettes, contains 74.02% C, 8.710% H, and 17.27% N. If 40.57 g of nicotine contains 0.2500 mol nicotine, what is the molecular formula?

<h4>Solution</h4>

f_C = 74.02 ％

f_H = 8.710  ％

f_N = 17.27  ％

m_sample = 40.57 g

n_sample = 0.2500 mol

Determining the molecular formula from the provided data will require comparison of the compound’s empirical formula mass to its molar mass. As the first step, use the percent composition to derive the compound’s empirical formula.

n_C = m_sample * f_C / M[C]

n_H = m_sample * f_H / M[H]

n_N = m_sample * f_N / M[N]

Now, divide by the chemical amount of nicotine present in the sample to obtain the coefficients of the molecular formula.

coeff_C = n_C / n_sample 

coeff_H = n_H / n_sample 

coeff_N = n_N / n_sample

The molecular formula is C10H14N2. As a check, we can calculate the molar mass of nicotine from the experimental data and compare it to that obtained from the molecular formula

M[C10H14N2] = sum(10 M[C], 14 M[H], 2 M[N])
<h3>Example 3.14: Calculating Molar Concentrations</h3>

A 355-mL soft drink sample contains 0.133 mol of sucrose (table sugar). What is the concentration of sucrose in the beverage?

<h4>Solution</h4>

V_solution = 355. mL

n_sucrose = 0.133 mol

Since the chemical amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the concentration can be calculated using its definition. 

c_sucrose = n_sucrose / V_solution

If we want to switch to the more common units mol/L, or short M:

__tutor__ = 1

c_sucrose using M



<h3>Example 3.15: Deriving Moles and Volumes from Molar Concentrations</h3>

How much sugar (chemical amount) is contained in a modest sip (~10 mL) of the soft drink from <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/3-3-molarity/#fs-idm98982768">Example 13</a>?

<h4>Solution</h4>

V_sip = 10 mL

n_sugar = ?

We derived derived the concentration of sugar, 0.375 M, in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/3-3-molarity/#fs-idm98982768">Example 13</a>, 0.375 M:

c_sugar = 0.375 M

In this case, we can rearrange the definition of concentration to isolate the quantity sought, n_sugar, the chemical amount of sugar. 

@ c_sugar = n_sugar / V_sip

n_sugar = c_sugar * V_sip

Or expressed in millimol:

n_sugar using mmol



<h3>Example 3.16: Calculating Molar Concentrations from the Mass of Solute</h3>

Distilled white vinegar (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_04_vinegar.jpg">Figure 15</a>) is a solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H, in water. A 0.500-L vinegar solution contains 25.2 g of acetic acid. What is the concentration of the acetic acid solution in units of mol/L or M?

<h4>Solution</h4>

V_solution = 0.500 L

m[CH3CO2H] = 25.2 g

c[CH3CO2H] = ?

As in previous examples, the definition of concentration is the primary equation used to calculate the quantity sought. In this case, the mass of solute is provided instead of its molar amount, so we must use the solute’s molar mass to obtain the chemical amount of solute:

n[CH3CO2H] = m[CH3CO2H] /M[CH3CO2H]

c[CH3CO2H] = n[CH3CO2H] / V_solution 

c[CH3CO2H] using M



<h3>Example 3.17: Determining the Mass of Solute in a Given Volume of Solution</h3>

How many grams of NaCl are contained in 0.250 L of a 5.30-M solution?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_NaCl = ?

c_NaCl = 5.30 M

V_solution = 0.250 L

The volume and concentration of the solution are specified, so the chemical amount (mol) of solute is easily computed as demonstrated in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/3-3-molarity/#fs-idm64107376">Example 14</a>:

n_NaCl = c_NaCl V_solution 

Finally, this chemical amount is used to derive the mass of NaCl:

m_NaCl = n_NaCl M[NaCl]



<h3>Example 3.18: Determining the Volume of Solution Containing a Given Mass of Solute</h3>

In <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/3-3-molarity/#fs-idm81897840">Example 15</a>, we found the typical concentration of vinegar to be 0.839 M. What volume of vinegar contains 75.6 g of acetic acid?

<h4>Solution</h4>

c_acetic_acid = 0.839 M

m_acetic_acid = 75.6 g

V_vinegar = ?

First, use the molar mass to calculate chemical amount of acetic acid (CH3CO2H) from the given mass:

n_acetic_acid = m_acetic_acid / M[CH3CO2H]

Then, use the concentration of the solution to calculate the volume of solution containing this chemical amount of solute:

@ c_acetic_acid = n_acetic_acid / V_vinegar

V_vinegar = n_acetic_acid / c_acetic_acid 

We could have combined these two steps into one to get the same answer:

@ V_vinegar = m_acetic_acid / (M[CH3CO2H] c_acetic_acid)



<h3>Example 3.19: Determining the Concentration of a Diluted Solution</h3>

If 0.850 L of a 5.00-M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the concentration of the diluted solution?

<h4>Solution</h4>

We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and c1, and the volume of the resultant diluted solution, V2. We need to find the concentration of the diluted solution, c2. 

V1 = 0.850 L

c1 = 5.00 M

V2 = 1.80 L

c2 = ?

We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate c2:

@ c1 V1 = c2 V2

@ c2 = c1 V1 / V2

Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased from 0.85 L to 1.80 L), we would expect the diluted solution’s concentration to be less than one-half 5 M. We will compare this ballpark estimate to the calculated result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, such as an improper substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms on the right side of this equation yields:

c2 = c1 (V1 / V2)

This result compares well to our ballpark estimate (it’s a bit less than one-half the stock concentration, 5 M).



<h3>Example 3.22: Calculation of Percent by Mass</h3>

A 5.0-g sample of spinal fluid contains 3.75 mg (0.00375 g) of glucose. What is the percent by mass of glucose in spinal fluid?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_sample = 5.0 g

m_glucose = 3.75 mg

The spinal fluid sample contains roughly 4 mg of glucose in 5000 mg of fluid, so the mass fraction of glucose should be a bit less than one part in 1000, or about 0.1%. Substituting the given masses into the equation defining mass percentage yields:

f_glucose = m_glucose / m_sample * 100 ％

The computed mass percentage agrees with our rough estimate (it’s a bit less than 0.1%).

Note that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg, g, kg, oz, and so on), the same unit must be used for both the solute and the solution before you can cancel the mass units, yielding a dimensionless ratio.



<h3>Example 3.23: Calculations using Mass Percentage</h3>

“Concentrated” hydrochloric acid is an aqueous solution of 37.2% HCl that is commonly used as a laboratory reagent. The density of this solution is 1.19 g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of this solution?

<h4>Solution</h4>

f_HCL_in_solution = 37.2 ％

ρ_solution = 1.19 g/mL

V_solution = 0.500 L

m_HCl = ?

The HCl concentration is near 40%, so a 100-g portion of this solution would contain about 40 g of HCl. Since the solution density isn’t greatly different from that of water (1 g/mL), a reasonable estimate of the HCl mass in 500 g (0.5 L) of the solution is about five times greater than that in a 100 g portion, or 5 times 40 g equals 200 g. 

In order to derive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage, we need to know the corresponding mass of the solution. Using the solution density given, we can convert the solution’s volume to mass, and then use the given mass percentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical approach is outlined in this flowchart:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_03_05_Example2_img.jpg", width="50%"}

m_solution = ρ_solution V_solution 

m_HCl = f_HCL_in_solution m_solution 

This mass of HCl is consistent with our rough estimate of approximately 200 g.





<h3>Example 3.24: Calculations using Volume Percentage</h3>

Rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) is usually sold as a 70%vol aqueous solution. If the density of isopropyl alcohol is 0.785 g/mL, how many grams of isopropyl alcohol are present in a 355 mL bottle of rubbing alcohol?

<h4>Solution</h4>

f_by_vol = 70 ％

V_solution = 355. mL

ρ_iPrOH = 0.785 g/mL

m_iPrOH = ?

Per the definition of volume percentage, the isopropanol volume is 70% of the total solution volume. Multiplying the isopropanol volume by its density yields the requested mass:

m_iPrOH = f_by_vol V_solution ρ_iPrOH 



<h3>Example 3.25: Calculation of Parts per Million and Parts per Billion Concentrations</h3>

According to the EPA, when the fraction by mass of lead in tap water reaches 15 ppb, certain remedial actions must be taken. What is this "concentration" in ppm? At this level, what mass of lead (μg) would be contained in a typical glass of water (300 mL)?

<h4>Solution</h4>

ppm = (1/1000000)

ppb = (1/1000000000)

V_glass = 300 mL

f_lead = 15. ppb

f_lead in ppm

The definition of the ppb unit may be used to calculate the requested mass if the mass of the solution is provided. However, only the volume of solution (300 mL) is given, so we must use the density to derive the corresponding mass. We can assume the density of tap water to be roughly the same as that of pure water (~1.00 g/mL), since the concentrations of any dissolved substances should not be very large.

ρ_solution = 1.00 g/mL

m_solution = ρ_solution V_glass

m_lead = f_lead m_solution

Finally, convert this mass to the requested unit of micrograms:

m_lead using μg

<h4>Answer:</h4>


m_skillet = 5.00E2 g

T_initial = 25. °aC

T_final = 250. °aC

cp = 0.451 J/(g °ΔC)

q = m_skillet cp (T_final -T_initial )

Think about it:

a) q is positive because the energy of the skillet increased

a) q is negative because the energy of the skillet increased

a) q is positive because the energy of the skillet decreased

a) q is negative because the energy of the skillet decreased

m_metal = 217. g

q = 1.43 kJ

T_initial = 24.5 °aC

<h3>Example 5.3b: Heat Transfer between Substances at Different Temperatures</h3>

A 248-g piece of copper is dropped into 390 mL of water at 22.6 °C. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 °C. Calculate the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs between the copper and the water.

<h4>Answer:</h4>


m[Cu] = 248. g

V_water = 390. mL

T_water_initial = 22.6 °aC

T_final = 39.9 °aC

T[Cu]initial = ?

c_p[Cu] = 0.385 J / (g °ΔC) # Table 1

c_p_water = 4.184 J / (g °ΔC)

@ q1 = m1 c_p_1 ΔT_1

@ q2 = m2 c_p_2 ΔT_2

@ q1 = -q2

m_water = V_water * 1 g/mL
ΔT_water = T_final - T_water_initial
q_water = m_water c_p_water ΔT_water
q[Cu] = -q_water

ΔT[Cu] = q[Cu] /(m[Cu] c_p[Cu]) 

T[Cu]initial = T_final - ΔT[Cu] 

Think about it: In which direction did the heat flow?
a) From copper to water because the copper got hotter and the water got colder
b) From copper to water because the copper got colder and the water got hotter
c) From water to copper because the copper got hotter and the water got colder
d) From water to copper because the copper got colder and the water got hotter
<h3>Example 13.1: Ion Concentrations in Pure Water</h3>

What are the hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration in pure water at 25 °C?

<h4>Solution</h4>

[H3O+] = ?

[OH-] = ?

The autoionization of water yields the same number of hydronium and hydroxide ions. Therefore, in pure water, [H3O+] = [OH-]. At 25 °C:

@ K_w = [H3O+][OH-] = 1.0e-14

Because in this case, [H3O+] = [OH-],

@ K_w = [H3O+]^2

So we can calculate [H3O+] from K_w for pure water (also works for any neutral aqueous solution):

K_w = 1.0e-14

[H3O+] = sqrt(K_w)

[OH-] = [H3O+]

The hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration are the same, and we find that both equal 1.0e-7 M.



<h3>Example 13.1b: Ion Concentrations in Pure Water</h3>

The ion product of water at 80 °C is 2.4 × 10^-13. What are the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in pure water at 80 °C?
<h4>Answer:</h4>

T = 80. °aC

K_w_80 = 2.4E-13

[H3O+] = ?

[OH-] = ?

@ K_w_80 = [H3O+] [OH-]

[H3O+] = sqrt(K_w_80)

[OH-] = [H3O+] 

Think about it: Compared to room temperature, at a higher temperature the hydronium ion concentration [H3O+] is

a) higher because water dissociates more

b) lower because water dissociates more

c) higher because water dissociates less

d) lower becuase water dissociates less



<h3>Example 13.2: The Inverse Proportionality of [H3O+] and [OH−]</h3>

A solution of carbon dioxide in water has a hydronium ion concentration of 2.0e-6 M. What is the concentration of hydroxide ion at 25 °C?

<h4>Solution</h4>

c[H3O+] = 2.0e-6 M

[H3O+] = c[H3O+] / 1 M # (in PQcalc, c_solute has units and [solute] does not)

[OH-] = ?

We know the value of the ion-product constant for water at 25 °C:

! 2H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq)! K_w=[H3O+][OH-]

K_w =1.0e-14

Thus, we can calculate the missing equilibrium concentration.

Rearrangement of the K_w expression yields that [OH-] is directly proportional to the inverse of [H3O+]:

[OH-]=K_w/[H3O+]

c[OH-] = 1 M [OH-]

The hydroxide ion concentration in water is reduced to 5.0 × 10^-9 M as the hydrogen ion concentration increases to 2.0 × 10^-6 M. This is expected from Le Châtelier’s principle; the autoionization reaction shifts to the left to reduce the stress of the increased hydronium ion concentration and the [OH^-] is reduced relative to that in pure water.

A check of these concentrations confirms that our arithmetic is correct:

K_w_check =[H3O+][OH-]

Think about it: For pure water, [H3O+] = [OH-] = 1.0e-7. The concentration of hydroxide for the solution considered here is:

a) larger than 1.0e-7 M because [H3O+] is larger than 1.0e-7

b) larger than 1.0e-7 M because [H3O+] is smaller than 1.0e-7

c) smaller than 1.0e-7 M because [H3O+] is larger than 1.0e-7

d) smaller than 1.0e-7 M because [H3O+] is smaller than 1.0e-7

<h3>Example 13.4b: Calculation of pH from [H3O+]</h3>

Water exposed to air contains carbonic acid, H2CO3, due to the reaction between carbon dioxide and water:

!CO2(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H2CO3(aq)

Air-saturated water has a hydronium ion concentration caused by the dissolved CO2 of 2.0e-6 M, about 20-times larger than that of pure water. Calculate the pH of the solution at 25 °C.

<h4>Answer:</h4>
5.7


c[H3O+] = 2.0E-6M

pH = ?

The pH is defined as pH = -log([H+]). Note that the argument of the logarithm (what you calculate the logarithm of) can't have units, and the value of the logarithm won't have units.

[H3O+] = c[H3O+] / 1 M

You can estimate that the pH will be around 6 because the order of magnitude of [H+] is 1.0e-6

pH = -log([H3O+])

Think about it: Is the pH acidic or basic (neutral would be pH = 7, so it is not neutral):

a) It is acidic because the pH is higher than 7

a) It is acidic because the pH is lower than 7

a) It is basic because the pH is higher than 7

a) It is basic because the pH is lower than 7





<h3>Example 13.4: Calculation of pH from [H3O+]</h3>

What is the pH of stomach acid, a solution of HCl with a hydronium ion concentration of 1.2e-3 M?

<h4>Solution</h4>

c[H3O+] = 1.2e-3 M

pH = ?

The pH is defined as 

@ pH = -log([H+]) = -log(c[H+]/1 M)

Before we can take the logaritm, we have to divide c[H3O+] by the standard concentration, 1M, to get the pure number [H3O+]

[H3O+] = c[H3O+] / 1M

pH=-log([H3O+])

(The use of logarithms is explained in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/essential-mathematics/">Appendix B</a>. Recall that, as we have done here, when taking the log of a value, keep as many decimal places in the result as there are significant figures in the value.)



<h3>Example 13.5: Calculation of Hydronium Ion Concentration from pH</h3>

Calculate the hydronium ion concentration of blood, the pH of which is 7.3 (slightly alkaline).

<h4>Solution</h4>

pH = 7.3

c[H3O+] = ?

@ pH=-log([H+])

We need to discuss some math before we can proceed. If you know how to solve for [H+], you can skip ahead.

<hr> 

So how do you solve for [H+], which is locked away inside the logarithm function? You solve for the argument of a function by first rearranging so that only the function is on one side of the equation, and then applying the inverse function to both sides. So...

1) Isolate the function on the left hand side of the equation:

@ log([H+]) = -pH 

2) Apply the inverse function to both sides. The inverse function of the base-10 logarithm is raising 10 to the power of:

@ 10^log([H+]) = 10^(-pH)

3) Applying the inverse function to a function pops out the argument

@ [H+] = 10^(-pH)

So 

@[H+] = 10^(-pH) 

is equivalent to 

@log([H+]) = -pH

Depending on which direction your calculation goes, one or the other form is more useful. If the steps above are unfamiliar to you, it is nice to have both forms available for reference.

<hr> Now we are ready to continue with the problem

[H3O+] = 10^-pH

(On a pocket calculator take the antilog, or the “inverse” log, of -7.3, or calculate 10^-7.3.)

To get the concentration (with units), multiply by 1 M:

c[H3O+] = 1 M [H3O+]



<h3>Example 13.5b: Calculation of Hydronium Ion Concentration from pH</h3>

Calculate the hydronium ion concentration of a solution with a pH of -1.07.

<h4>Answer:</h4>


pH = -1.07 

c[H3O+] = ?

@ -pH = log([H+])

[H3O+] = 10^-pH 

c[H3O+] = 1M [H3O+] 

Think about it: Mostly, pH values are in the range of 0 to 14. Here, we have a negative value for the pH. What does that mean?

a) The solution is very acidic, and the concentration of H+ is negative.

b) The solution is very acidic, and the concentration of H+ is higher than 1 M.

c) The solution is very basic, and the concentration of H+ is negative.

d) The solution is very basic, and the concentration of H+ is higher than 1 M.



<h3>Example 13.6: Calculation of pOH</h3>

What are the pOH and the pH of a 0.0125-M solution of potassium hydroxide, KOH?

<h4>Solution</h4>

[KOH] = 0.0125

pH = ?

pOH = ?

Potassium hydroxide is a highly soluble ionic compound and completely dissociates when dissolved in dilute solution, yielding c[OH-] = 0.0125 M. 

[OH-] = [KOH]

Because we know c[OH-], it makes sense to calculate the pOH first:

pOH = -log([OH-])

The pH can be found from the pOH:

@ pH + pOH = 14.00

pH = 14.00 - pOH



<h3>Example 13.6b: Calculation of pOH</h3>

The hydronium ion concentration of vinegar is approximately 4 × 10^-3 M. What are the corresponding values of pOH and pH?

<h4>Answer:</h4>
[H3O+] = 4.E-3

pH = ?

pOH = ?

In this case, we start by calculating the pH because we know the H3O+ concentration.

pH = -log([H3O+])

pOH = 14.00 - pH

Think about it. What can we say about this solution?

a) It is acidic because pH is small and pOH is large.

b) It is acidic because pOH is small and pH is large.

c) It is basic because pH is small and pOH is large.

d) It is basic because pOH is small and pH is large.



<h3>Example 13.7: Calculation of Percent Ionization from pH</h3>

Calculate the percent ionization of a 0.125-M solution of nitrous acid (a weak acid), with a pH of 2.09.

<h4>Solution</h4>

pH = 2.09

[HNO2]0 = 0.125

The percent ionization for an acid is:

@ fraction_ionized = [H3O+]eq/[HNO2]0 * 100％

The chemical equation for the dissociation of the nitrous acid is

!HNO2(aq) + H2O(l) <=> NO2-(aq) + H3O+(aq)

Since 10^-pH = [H3O+], we find:

[H3O+]eq = 10^-pH

fraction_ionized = [H3O+]eq/[HNO2]0 * 100％

Remember, the logarithm 2.09 indicates a hydronium ion concentration with only two significant figures.

Calculate the percent ionization of a 0.10-M solution of acetic acid with a pH of 2.89.

[acetic acid]0 = 0.10

pH = 2.89 

fraction_ionization = ?

Plan 1) [H3O+]eq 2) percent ionization

[H3O+]eq = 10^-pH

Think about it: What kind of acid is acetic acid?

a) It is strong because the percent ionization is near 100%.

b) It is strong because the percent ionization is low.

c) It is weak because the percent ionization is near 100%.

<h3>Example 13.8: The Product K_a * K_b = K_w</h3>

Use the K_b for the nitrite ion, NO2-, to calculate the K_a for its conjugate acid.

<h4>Solution</h4>K_b for NO2- is given in this section as 2.17e-11. 

K_b[NO2-] = 2.17e-11

The conjugate acid of NO2- is HNO2:

!NO2- + H+ <=> HNO2! K_a

!HNO2 + OH- <=> NO2- + H2O! K_b

K_a for HNO2 can be calculated using the relationship:

@ K_a * K_b = K_w

K_w = 1.0e-14

Solving for Ka, we get:

K_a[NO2-] = K_w / K_b[NO2-] 

This answer can be verified by finding the K_a for HNO2 in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/ionization-constants-of-weak-acids/">Appendix H</a>.



<h3>Example 13.8b: The Product K_a * K_b = K_w</h3>

We can determine the relative acid strengths of NH4+ and HCN by comparing their ionization constants. The ionization constant of HCN is given in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/ionization-constants-of-weak-acids/">Appendix H</a> as 4.9e-10. The ionization constant of NH4+ is not listed, but the ionization constant of its conjugate base, NH3, is listed as 1.8e-5. Determine the ionization constant of NH4+, and decide which is the stronger acid, HCN or NH4+.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

NH4+ is the slightly stronger acid (K_a for NH4+ = 5.6e-10)

K_a[HCN] = 4.9e-10

K_a[NH3] = ?

K_b[NH3] = 1.8e-5

K_w = 1.00e-14

K_a[NH4+] =K_w / K_b[NH3] 

A larger K_a means that the ionization of an acid is more on the side of the products, so NH4+ is a stronger acid than HCN.



<h3>Example 13.9: Determination of K_a from Equilibrium Concentrations</h3>

Acetic acid is the principal ingredient in vinegar (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_03_Vinegar.jpg">Figure 11</a>); that's why it tastes sour. At equilibrium, a solution contains c[CH3CO2H] = 0.0787 M and c[H3O+]=c[CH3CO2-]=0.00118M. What is the value of K_a for acetic acid?

<h4>Solution</h4>

[CH3CO2H]eq = 0.0787

[H3O+]eq =0.00118 

[CH3CO2-]eq =0.00118

K_a = ?

We are asked to calculate an equilibrium constant from equilibrium concentrations. At equilibrium, the value of the equilibrium constant is equal to the reaction quotient for the reaction:

!CH3CO2H(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + CH3CO2- (aq)

@ K_a= [H3O+]eq [CH3CO2-]eq / [CH3CO2H]eq

K_a= [H3O+]eq [CH3CO2-]eq / [CH3CO2H]eq



<h3>Example 13.9b: Determination of Ka from Equilibrium Concentrations</h3>

What is the equilibrium constant for the ionization of the HSO4- ion, the weak acid used in some household cleansers:

! HSO4-(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + SO4^2-(aq)

In one mixture of NaHSO4 and Na2SO4 at equilibrium, c[H3O+] = 0.027 M; c[HSO4-]=0.29M; and c[SO4^2-]=0.13M.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

Ka for HSO4- = 1.2 × 10^-

[H3O+] = 0.027 

[HSO4-] = 0.29 

[SO4^2-] = 0.13

K_a = [H3O+] [SO4^2-] / [HSO4-] 

Think about it: The problem states that HSO4- is a weak acid. How is K_a related to the strength of an acid:

a) The larger K_a, the stronger the acid
b) The smaller K_a, the stronger the acid
c) You would need to know the concentration of the acid as well to make a statement
d) You would need to know the pH of the solution as well to make a statement

<h3>Example 13.10: Determination of Kb from Equilibrium Concentrations</h3>

Caffeine, C8H10N4O2 is a weak base. What is the value of Kb for caffeine if a solution at equilibrium has c[C8H10N4O2] = 0.050 M; c[C8H10N4O2H+] = 5.0e-3 M; and c[OH-] = 2.5e-3 M?

<h4>Solution</h4>

[C8H10N4O2]eq = 0.050

[C8H10N4O2H+]eq = 5.0e-3

[OH-]eq = 2.5e-3

At equilibrium, the value of the equilibrium constant is equal to the reaction quotient for the reaction:

!C8H10N4O2(aq) + H2O(l) <=> C8H10N4O2H+(aq) + OH-(aq)

K_b = [C8H10N4O2H+]eq [OH-]eq/[C8H10N4O2]eq



<h3>Example 13.10b: Determination of Kb from Equilibrium Concentrations</h3>

What is the equilibrium constant for the ionization of the HPO4^2- ion, a weak base:

!HPO4^2-(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H2PO4-(aq) + OH-(aq)

In a solution containing a mixture of NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 at equilibrium, c[OH-] = 1.3e-6 M; c[H2PO4-]=0.042M; and c[HPO4^2-]=0.341M.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

Kb for HPO42-=1.6×10-

[OH-]eq = 1.3e-6

[H2PO4-]eq =0.042

[HPO4^2-]eq =0.341

K_b = [H2PO4-]eq [OH-]eq / [HPO4^2-]eq

Think about it: What does a K_b of 1.6e-7 mean?
a) Solutions of this base in water have close to neutral pH
b) This base is weaker than one with a larger K_b
c) This base is weaker than one with a smaller K_b
d) The K_b is so low, this substance is not considered a base but instead a spectator ion

<h3>Example 13.11: Determination of Ka or Kb from pH</h3>

The pH of a 0.0516-M solution of nitrous acid, HNO2, is 2.34. What is its K_a?

! HNO2(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + NO2-(aq)

<h4>Solution</h4>

pH = 2.34

[HNO2]init = 0.0516

K_a = ?

We determine an equilibrium constant starting with the initial concentrations of HNO2, H3O+, and NO2- as well as one of the final concentrations, the concentration of hydronium ion at equilibrium. (Remember that pH is simply another way to express the concentration of hydronium ion.)

We can solve this problem with the following steps in which x is a change in concentration of a species in the reaction:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_03_steps_img.jpg", width="30%"}

We can summarize the various concentrations and changes as shown here (the concentration of water does not appear in the expression for the equilibrium constant, so we do not need to consider its concentration):

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_03_ICETable1_img.jpg", width="50%"}

To get the various values in the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table, we first calculate [H3O+], the equilibrium concentration of H3O+, from the pH:

[H3O+]eq = 10^-pH

The change in concentration of H3O+, Δ[H3O+], is the difference between the equilibrium concentration of H3O+, which we determined from the pH, and the initial concentration, [H3O]i. The initial concentration of H3O+ is its concentration in pure water, which is so much less than the final concentration that we approximate it as zero (~0).

Δ[H3O+] = [H3O+]eq - 0

The change in concentration of NO2- is equal to the change in concentration of [H3O+]. For each 1 mol of H3O+ that forms, 1 mol of NO2- forms. The equilibrium concentration of HNO2 is equal to its initial concentration plus the change in its concentration.

Δ[NO2-] = Δ[H3O+]

Δ[HNO2] = -Δ[H3O+]

[NO2-]eq = Δ[NO2-] + 0

[HNO2]eq = Δ[HNO2] + [HNO2]init

Now we can fill in the ICE table with the concentrations at equilibrium, as shown here:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_03_ICETable2_img.jpg", width="50%"}

Finally, we calculate the value of the equilibrium constant using the data in the table:

K_a = [H3O+]eq [NO2-]eq /[HNO2]eq 



<h3>Example 13.11b: Determination of Ka or Kb from pH</h3>

The pH of a solution of household ammonia, a 0.950-M solution of NH3, is 11.612. What is K_b for NH3.

<h4>Answer:</h4>
[NH3]init = 0.950

pH = 11.612

K_b = ? 

! NH3 + H2O <=> NH4+ + OH-

@K_b = [NH4+]eq [OH-]eq / [NH3]eq

pOH = 14.00 - pH

[OH-]eq = 10^-pOH

Δ[OH-] = [OH-]eq - 0

Δ[NH4+] = Δ[OH-]  

Δ[NH3] =  -Δ[OH-]  

[NH3]eq = [NH3]init + Δ[NH3] 

[NH4+]eq = Δ[NH4+] + 0

K_b = [NH4+]eq [OH-]eq / [NH3]eq 

Think about it: What is a good estimate for the pH of a strong base at the same concentration (0.959 M)?

a) You would need to know the K_b of that strong base to make an estimate

b) pH ~ 0 because the concentration is close to 1 M

c) pH ~ 14 because pOH ~ 0

d) pH would be neutral you need an acid (H+ donor) to change the pH



<h3>Example 13.12: Equilibrium Concentrations in a Solution of a Weak Acid</h3>

Formic acid, HCO2H, is the irritant that causes the body’s reaction to ant stings (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_03_AntSting.jpg">Figure 12</a>).

What is the concentration of hydronium ion and the pH in a 0.534-M solution of formic acid?

! HCO2H(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + HCO2-(aq)

<h4>Solution</h4>

K_a=1.8e-4

[HCO2H]init = 0.534

Determine x and equilibrium concentrations. The equilibrium expression is:

@K_a = [H3O+]eq [HCO2-]eq / [HCO2H]eq

The concentration of water does not appear in the expression for the equilibrium constant, so we do not need to consider its change in concentration when setting up the ICE table.

The table shows initial concentrations (concentrations before the acid ionizes), changes in concentration, and equilibrium concentrations follows (the data given in the problem appear in color):

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_03_ICETable3_img.jpg", width="50%"}

Solve for x and the equilibrium concentrations. At equilibrium:

@ K_a = [H3O+][HCO2-]/[HCO2H] = (x)(x)/([HCO2H]init - x)

Because the initial concentration of acid is reasonably large and K_a is very small, we assume that x << [HCO2H]init, which permits us to simplify the denominator term as ([HCO2H]init - x) = [HCO2H]init. This gives:

@ K_a = x^2 / [HCO2H]init

Now solve for x as follows:

@ [HCO2H]init K_a = x^2

@ x = sqrt(K_a [HCO2H]init)

x = sqrt(K_a [HCO2H]init)

To check the assumption that x is small compared to 0.534, we calculate the ratio and express it in percent:

ratio = x / 0.534 * 100 ％

x is less than 5% of the initial concentration; the assumption is valid.

We find the equilibrium concentration of hydronium ion in this formic acid solution from its initial concentration and the change in that concentration as indicated in the last line of the table:

[H3O+]eq = 0 + x

The pH of the solution can be found by taking the negative log of the [H3O+], so:

pH = -log([H3O+]eq)



<h3>Example 13.12b: Equilibrium Concentrations in a Solution of a Weak Acid</h3>

Only a small fraction of a weak acid ionizes in aqueous solution. What is the percent ionization of acetic acid in a 0.100-M solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H?

! CH3CO2H(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + CH3CO2-(aq) !K_a=1.8e-5

(Hint: Determine [CH3CO2-] at equilibrium.) Recall that the percent ionization is the fraction of acetic acid that is ionized × 100％, or [CH3CO2-]/[CH3CO2H]initial×100.

<h4>Answer:</h4>


[CH3CO2H]initial = 0.100

K_a = 1.8e-5

@ K_a = [H3O+]eq [CH3CO2-]eq / [CH3CO2H]eq = x^2 /([CH3CO2H]initial - x)

x = sqrt(K_a [CH3CO2H]initial)

[CH3CO2-]eq = x

fraction_ionized = [CH3CO2-]eq / [CH3CO2H]initial * 100％

Think about it: What concentration of a strong acid such as HCl would result in a similar concentration of H3O+ and a similar pH as 0.100 M acetic acid?

a) same concentration

b) strong acids always result in a more acidic solution, regardless of concentration

c) 1.34% of 0.100 M, so about 1 mM

d) there is no H3O+ in a solution of acetic acid (the acetic acid itself makes it taste sour)



e) acetic acid is not acidic





<h3>Example 13.20: pH Changes in Buffered and Unbuffered Solutions</h3>

(a) Calculate the pH of an acetate buffer that is a mixture with 0.100 M acetic acid and 0.100 M sodium acetate.

<h4>Solution</h4>

To determine the pH of the buffer solution we use a typical equilibrium calculation (as illustrated in earlier Examples):

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_06_steps1_img.jpg", width="50%"}

Determine the direction of change. The equilibrium in a mixture of H3O^+, CH3CO2-, and CH3CO2H is:

! CH3CO2H(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + CH3CO2-(aq)

The equilibrium constant for CH3CO2H is not given, so we look it up in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/ionization-constants-of-weak-acids/">Appendix H</a>: 

K_a = 1.8e-5

[CH3CO2H]init = 0.10

[CH3CO2-]init = 0.10

With 

@[CH3CO2H]init = [CH3CO2-]init = 0.10 M and [H3O+] = ~0 M

the reaction shifts to the right to form H3O+.

Determine x and equilibrium concentrations. A table of changes and concentrations follows:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_06_ICETable16_img.jpg", width="50%"}

Solve for x and the equilibrium concentrations. We find:

@K_a = [CH3CO2-]eq [H3O+] / [CH3CO2H]eq = ([CH3CO2-]init+x) x / ([CH3CO2H]init - x)

@x = K_a ([CH3CO2H]init - x)/([CH3CO2-]init+x)

x = K_a

and

[H3O+] = 0 + x

Thus:

pH = -log([H3O+])

Check the work. If we calculate all calculated equilibrium concentrations, we find that the equilibrium value of the reaction coefficient, Q = K_a.

<hr>

(b) Calculate the pH after 1.00 mL of 0.100 M NaOH is added to 100 mL of this buffer, giving a solution with a volume of 101 mL.

First, we calculate the concentrations of an intermediate mixture resulting from the complete reaction between the acid in the buffer and the added base. Then we determine the concentrations of the mixture at the new equilibrium:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_06_steps2_img.jpg", width="50%"}

Determine the chemical amount of NaOH. One milliliter (0.0010 L) of 0.10 M NaOH contains:

c[NaOH] = 0.100 M

V[NaOH] = 1.00 mL

n[NaOH] = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]

Determine the chemical amount of CH2CO2H. Before reaction, 100 mL of the buffer solution contains:

V[CH3CO2H] = 100 mL

c[CH3CO2H] = 0.100 M

n[CH3CO2H] = V[CH3CO2H] * c[CH3CO2H]

n[NaCH3CO2] = n[CH3CO2H] #(same volume and concentration as CH3CO2H)

Solve for the amount of NaCH3CO2 produced. The 1.0 × 10^-4 mol of NaOH neutralizes 1.0 × 10^-4 mol of CH3CO2H, leaving:

n[CH3CO2H]mix = n[CH3CO2H] - n[NaOH]

and producing 1.0 × 10^-4 mol of NaCH3CO2. This makes a total of:

n[NaCH3CO2]mix = n[NaCH3CO2] + n[NaOH]

Find the concentration of the products. After reaction, CH3CO2H and NaCH3CO2 are contained in 101 mL of the intermediate solution, so:

V_mix = 101. mL

[CH3CO2H]mix = n[CH3CO2H]mix / V_mix

[NaCH3CO2]mix = n[NaCH3CO2]mix / V_mix

Now we calculate the pH after the intermediate solution, which is 0.098 M in CH3CO2H and 0.100 M in NaCH3CO2, comes to equilibrium. The calculation is very similar to that in part (a) of this example:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_06_steps3_img.jpg", width="50%"}

This series of calculations gives a pH of 4.75. Thus the addition of the base barely changes the pH of the solution (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_06_compare.jpg">Figure 17</a>).

<hr>

(c) For comparison, calculate the pH after 1.00 mL of 0.100 M NaOH is added to 100 mL of a solution of an unbuffered solution with a pH of 4.74 (a 1.8e-5 M solution of HCl). The volume of the final solution is 101 mL.

<h4>Solution</h4>

V[HCl] = 100. mL

c[HCl] = 1.8e-5 M

This 1.8 × 10^-5-M solution of HCl has the same hydronium ion concentration as the 0.10-M solution of acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer described in part (a) of this example. The solution contains:

n[HCl] = c[HCl] V[HCl]

As shown in part (b), 1 mL of 0.10 M NaOH contains 1.0 × 10^-4 mol of NaOH. When the NaOH and HCl solutions are mixed, the HCl is the limiting reagent in the reaction. All of the HCl reacts, and the amount of NaOH that remains is:

n[NaOH]mix = n[NaOH] - n[HCl]

The concentration of NaOH is:

c[NaOH]mix = n[NaOH]mix / V_mix

The pOH of this solution is:

pOH = -log(c[NaOH]mix / 1 M)

The pH is:

pH = 14.00-pOH

The pH changes from 4.74 to 10.99 in this unbuffered solution. This compares to the change of 4.74 to 4.75 that occurred when the same amount of NaOH was added to the buffered solution described in part (b).



<h3>Example 13.20b: pH Changes in Buffered and Unbuffered Solutions</h3>

Show that adding 1.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl changes the pH of 100 mL of a 1.8e-5 M HCl solution from 4.74 to 3.00.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

pH = 3.0

V_add = 1.0 mL

c_add = 0.10 M

V_init = 100. mL

c_init = 1.8E-5M

pH_init = ?

pH_mix = ?

@pH_init = 4.74 

@pH_mix = 3.00 

pH_init = -log(c_init / 1 M)

c_mix = (c_init V_init + c_add V_add) / (V_init + V_add)

pH_mix = -log(c_mix / 1M)



Think about it: What had a greater influence on the pH in the mix, i.e. brought in more H+ ions?

a) The solution with the higher volume and higher concentration

b) The solution with the higher volume and lower concentration

c) The solution with the lower volume and higher concentration

d) The solution with the lower volume and lower concentration



<h3>Example 13.21: Calculating pH for Titration Solutions: Strong Acid+Strong Base</h3>

A titration is carried out for 25.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl (strong acid) with 0.100 M of a strong base NaOH the titration curve is shown in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_14_07_titration.jpg">Figure 21</a>. Calculate the pH at these volumes of added base solution:

(a) 0.00 mL

(b) 12.50 mL

(c) 25.00 mL

(d) 37.50 mL

<h4>Solution</h4>

c[HCl] = 0.100 M

c[NaOH] = 0.100 M

V[HCl] = 25.00 mL

V[NaOH]a = 0.00 mL

V[NaOH]b = 12.50 mL

V[NaOH]c = 25.00 mL

V[NaOH]d = 37.50 mL

pH_a = ?

pH_b = ?

pH_c = ?

pH_d = ?

<hr>Part (a) Determining the pH before any NaOH is added is straightforward. We are looking at a strong acid with known concentration, so we know the concentration of H3O+ and can calculate the pH

pH_a = -log(c[HCl] / 1 M)

<hr>Plan for parts (b), (c), and (d)

The HCl solution provides H3O+, and the added NaOH provides OH-. The H3O+ and OH- ions neutralize each other; the species that was in excess remains, and its concentration determines the pH. For each point in the titration, we have to determine the amount of H3O+ and OH- present before neutralization to figure out what remains after neutralization. At first, H3O+ will be in excess and the solution will be acidic. Eventually, sufficient OH- is added to neutralize all of the H3O+ with OH- remaining, and the solution will be basic.

! H3O+ + OH- -> 2H2O

The amount of H3O+ provided by the HCl solution is the same for all points in the titration (because we are not adding any more HCl solution during the titration):

n[H3O+]initial = c[HCl] V[HCl] 

The amount of OH- provided by the NaOH solution and the total volume of the solution changes as the titration proceeds, so we have to calculate these separately for parts (b), (c) and (d)

<hr>Part (b)

Because strong bases dissociate completely, the amount of OH- ions provided by the NaOH solution is equal to the amount of NaOH added. 

n[OH-]initial_b = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]b

In the neutralization reaction, H3O+ and OH- react in a ratio of 1:1, so the limiting reactant is simply the one present at lower amount. However, we will also show this by calculating how much H3O+ and OH- remain after neutralization

n[->]b = min(n[H3O+]initial/1, n[OH-]initial_b/1)

n[H3O+]remaining_b = n[H3O+]initial - n[->]b

n[OH-]remaining_b = n[OH-]initial_b - n[->]b

So OH- is used up and some H3O+ remains. For calculating the pH, we need a concentration, not an amount, so we will calculate the volume of the mixture at point (b), then calculate the concentration and then the pH:

V_total_b = V[HCl] + V[NaOH]b 

c[H3O+]remaining_b = n[H3O+]remaining_b / V_total_b 

pH_b = -log(c[H3O+]remaining_b / 1 M)

<hr>Part (c)

n[OH-]initial_c = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]c 

n[->]c = min(n[H3O+]initial/1, n[OH-]initial_c/1)

n[H3O+]remaining_c = n[H3O+]initial - n[->]c

n[OH-]remaining_c = n[OH-]initial_c - n[->]c

At point (c), the initial amounts of H3O+ and OH- are equal. After neutralization, it is as if we had not added any strong acid or base to the solution. Because of the autodissociation of water, however, the H3O+ concentration is not zero.

K_w = 1.00e-14

pH_c = -log(sqrt(K_w))

<hr> Part (d)

n[OH-]initial_d = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]d 

n[->]d = min(n[H3O+]initial/1, n[OH-]initial_d/1)

n[H3O+]remaining_d = n[H3O+]initial - n[->]d

n[OH-]remaining_d = n[OH-]initial_d - n[->]d

At point (d), OH- is in excess over H3O+, i.e. after neutralization, some OH- will remain and determine the pH.

V_total_d = V[HCl] + V[NaOH]d  

c[OH-]remaining_d  = n[OH-]remaining_d /V_total_d 

Now we can first calculate the pOH, and from that the pH

pOH_d = -log(c[OH-]remaining_d / 1M)

pH_d = 14.00 - pOH_d

To summarize, the initial pH is 1.00, which then goes up to 1.48, 7.00 and 12.30 in the course of the titration.



<h3>Example 13.21b: Calculating pH for Titration Solutions: Strong Acid/Strong Base</h3>

Calculate the pH for the strong acid/strong base titration between 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HNO3(aq) and 0.200 M NaOH (titrant) at the listed volumes of added base: 0.00 mL, 15.0 mL, 25.0 mL, and 40.0 mL.

<h4>Answer:</h4>
V[HNO3] = 50.0 mL

c[HNO3] = 0.100 M

c[NaOH] = 0.200 M

V[NaOH]a = 0.00 mL

V[NaOH]b = 15.0 mL

V[NaOH]c = 25.0 mL

V[NaOH]d = 40.0 mL

<hr> Part (a): pH of strong acid

pH_a = -log(c[HNO3] / 1M)

<hr> Part (b): mixture of strong acid and strong base

! HNO3 + NaOH -> H2O + Na+ + NO3- ! 1:1 stoichiometry

n[H3O+]initial = c[HNO3] V[HNO3] 

n[OH-]initial_b = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]b  

H3O+ is in excess. Let's calculate the concentration:
n[H3O+]remaining_b = n[H3O+]initial - n[OH-]initial_b
V_total_b = V[HNO3] + V[NaOH]b
c[H3O+]remaining_b = n[H3O+]remaining_b / V_total_b

pH_b = -log(c[H3O+]remaining_b / 1M)

<hr> Part (c): mixture of strong acid and strong base

n[OH-]initial_c = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]c 

Stoichiometric amounts, neutral solution

pH_c = 7.00

<hr> Part (d): mixture of strong acid and strong base

n[OH-]initial_d = c[NaOH] V[NaOH]d 

OH- is in excess. Let's calculate the concentration:
n[OH-]remaining_d = n[OH-]initial_d - n[H3O+]initial
V_total_d = V[HNO3] + V[NaOH]d
c[OH-]remaining_d = n[OH-]remaining_d / V_total_d

pOH_d = -log(c[OH-]remaining_d / 1M)

pH_d = 14.00 - pOH_d


<h3>Example 16.1: Redistribution of Matter during a Spontaneous Process</h3>

Describe how matter is redistributed when the following spontaneous processes take place:

(a) A solid sublimes.

(b) A gas condenses.

(c) A drop of food coloring added to a glass of water forms a solution with uniform color.

<h4>Solution</h4>

<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_16_02_Process.jpg">Figure 6(credit a: modification of work by Jenny Downing; credit b: modification of work by “Fuzzy Gerdes”/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Sahar Atwa)

(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition.

(b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition.

(c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout.



<h3>Example 16.1b: Redistribution of Matter during a Spontaneous Process</h3>
Describe how matter and/or energy is redistributed when you empty a canister of compressed air into a room.
<h4>Answer:</h4>
This is also a dilution process, analogous to example (c). It entails both a greater and more uniform dispersal of matter as the compressed air in the canister is permitted to expand into the lower-pressure air of the room

<h3>Example 16.2: Determination of ΔS</h3>

Consider the system shown here. What is the change in entropy for a process that converts the system from distribution (a) to (c)?

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_16_03_Matter_img.jpg", width="50%"}

<h4>Solution</h4>

We are interested in the following change:

The initial number of microstates is one, the final six:

W_a = 1

W_c = 6

@ΔS = k_B ln(W_c/W_a)

R_gas = 8.314 J/(K mol)

N_A = 6.022e23 / mol

k_B = R_gas / N_A

ΔS = k_B ln(W_c/W_a)

The sign of this result is consistent with expectation; since there are more microstates possible for the final state than for the initial state, the change in entropy should be positive.





<h3>Example 16.2b: Determination of ΔS</h3>

Consider the system shown in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_16_03_Energy.jpg">Figure 9</a>. What is the change in entropy for the process where all the energy is transferred from the hot object (AB) to the cold object (CD)?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

no change, same number of micro states



<h3>Example 16.3: Predicting the Sign of ∆S</h3>

Predict the sign of the entropy change for the following processes. Indicate the reason for each of your predictions.

![a] One mole liquid water at room temperature  ->  one mole liquid water at 50 °C

![b] Ag+(aq) +Cl-(aq) -> AgCl(s)

![c] C6H6(l) +15/2O2(g) -> 6CO2(g) +3H2O(l)

![d] NH3(s) -> NH3(l)

<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) positive, temperature increases

(b) negative, reduction in the number of ions (particles) in solution, decreased dispersal of matter

(c) negative, net decrease in the amount of gaseous species

(d) positive, phase transition from solid to liquid, net increase in dispersal of matter



<h3>Example 16.3b: Predicting the Sign of ∆S</h3>

Predict the sign of the enthalpy change for the following processes. Give a reason for your prediction.

![a] NaNO3(s) -> Na +(aq) +NO3-(aq)

![b] !the freezing of liquid water

![c] CO2(s) -> CO2(g)

![d] CaCO(s) -> CaO(s) +CO2(g)

<h4>Answer:</h4>

(a) Positive; The solid dissolves to give an increase of mobile ions in solution. 

(b) Negative; The liquid becomes a more ordered solid. 

(c) Positive; The relatively ordered solid becomes a gas. 

(d) Positive; There is a net production of one mole of gas



<h3>Example 16.4: Will Ice Spontaneously Melt?</h3>

The entropy change for the process

!H2O(s) -> H2O(l)

is 22.1 J/K and requires that the surroundings transfer 6.00 kJ of heat to the system. Is the process spontaneous at -10.00 °C? Is it spontaneous at  +10.00 °C?

<h4>Solution</h4>

ΔS_sys = 22.1 J/K

q_surr = -6.00 kJ

@ΔSsurr = q_surr / T

T1 = -10.00 °aC

T2 = 10.00 °aC

We can assess the spontaneity of the process by calculating the entropy change of the universe. If ΔSuniv is positive, then the process is spontaneous. At both temperatures, ΔSsys = 22.1 J/K and qsurr = -6.00 kJ.

At -10.00 °C (263.15 K), the following is true:

ΔS_surr_1 = q_surr / T1

ΔS_univ = ΔS_sys + ΔS_surr_1

ΔS_univ < 0, so melting is nonspontaneous (not spontaneous) at -10.0 °C.

At 10.00 °C (283.15 K), the following is true:

ΔS_surr_2 = q_surr / T2

ΔS_univ_2 = ΔS_sys + ΔS_surr_2

ΔSuniv > 0, so melting is spontaneous at 10.00 °C.



<h3>Example 16.4b: Will Ice Spontaneously Melt?</h3>

In example 16.4, ΔS_univ for melting of ice was determined at two different temperatures:

ΔS_univ = -0.7 J/K for T = -10.00 °C

ΔS_univ =  0.9 J/K for T =  10.00 °C

Using this information, determine if liquid water will spontaneously freeze at the same temperatures. What can you say about the values of Suniv?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

Entropy is a state function, and freezing is the opposite of melting. At -10.00 °C spontaneous,  +0.7 J/K; at  +10.00 °C nonspontaneous, -0.9 J/K



<h3>Example 16.5: Determination of ΔS°</h3>

Calculate the standard entropy change for the following process:

!H2O(g) -> H2O(l)

<h4>Solution</h4>

The value of the standard entropy change at room temperature, ΔS°_298, is the difference between the standard entropy of the product, H2O(l), and the standard entropy of the reactant, H2O(g).

@ΔS°_298 = S°[H2O(l)]298 - S°[H2O(g)]298

S°[H2O(l)]298 = 70.0 J /(mol K)

S°[H2O(g)]298 = 188.8 J / (mol K)

ΔS°_298 = S°[H2O(l)]298 - S°[H2O(g)]298

The value for ΔS°_298 is negative, as expected for this phase transition (condensation), which the previous section discussed.



<h3>Example 16.5b: Determination of ΔS°</h3>

Calculate the standard entropy change for the following process:

!H2(g) +C2H4(g) -> C2H6(g)

<h4>Answer:</h4>

S°[H2(g)] = 130.7 J /(K mol)

S°[C2H4(g)] = 219.3 J /(K mol)

S°[C2H6(g)] = 229.2 J /(K mol)

ΔS° = S°[C2H6(g)] - S°[C2H4(g)]  - S°[H2(g)] 

-120.6 J mol^-1 K^-

Think about it: We expect the entropy to...

a) increase because the number of gas particles increases

a) decrease because the number of gas particles increases

a) increase because the number of gas particles decreases

a) decrease because the number of gas particles decreases

Calculate the standard entropy change for the combustion of methanol, CH3OH:

!2CH3OH(l) +3O2(g) -> 2CO2(g) +4H2O(l)

<h4>Solution</h4>

The value of the standard entropy change is equal to the difference between the standard entropies of the products and the entropies of the reactants scaled by their stoichiometric coefficients.

@ΔS°_298= sum(ν S°[products]298) - sum(ν S°[reactants]298)

S°[CO2(g)]298 = 213.8 J/(mol K)

S°[H2O(l)]298 = 70.0 J/(mol K)

S°[CH3OH(l)]298 = 126.8 J/(mol K)

S°[O2(g)]298 = 205.03 J/(mol K)

ΔS°_298= sum(2 S°[CO2(g)]298, 4 S°[H2O(l)]298) - sum(2 S°[CH3OH(l)]298, 3 S°[O2(g)]298)

!ΔS°= -161.1J/mol·K

Think about it: The entropy in this reaction decreases (less freedom). What would you expect for the same reaction if water as a product would form as a gas (S°[H2O(g)]298 is 188.8 J/(mol K))?

a) The entropy would increase because the number of gas particles increases

b) The entropy would increase because the number of gas particles increases

c) The entropy would increase because the number of gas particles increases

d) The entropy would increase because the number of gas particles increases

<h4>Answer:</h4>

24.7 J/mol

ΔS° = ?

S°[H2O(l)] = 70.0 J/(mol K)

S°[Ca(OH)2(s)] = 83.4  J/(mol K)

S°[CaO(s)] = 38.1 J/(mol K)

ΔS° = S°[H2O(l)] +S°[CaO(s)] -S°[Ca(OH)2(s)] 

Think about it: Looking at the chemical reaction, we expect the entropy to

a) decrease because the number of molecules in the liquid state decreases

a) increase because the number of molecules in the liquid state decreases

a) decrease because the number of molecules in the liquid state increases

a) increase because the number of molecules in the liquid state increases



<h3>Example 16.7: Evaluation of ΔG° Change from ΔH° and ΔS°</h3>

Use standard enthalpy and entropy data from <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/standard-thermodynamic-properties-for-selected-substances/">Appendix G</a> to calculate the standard free energy change for the vaporization of water at room temperature (298 K). What does the computed value for ΔG° say about the spontaneity of this process?

<h4>Solution</h4>

The process of interest is the following:

!H2O(l) -> H2O(g)

The standard change in free energy may be calculated using the following equation:

@ΔG298°=ΔH°-T ΔS°

From <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/standard-thermodynamic-properties-for-selected-substances/">Appendix G</a>, here is the data:

Substance

ΔHf°[H2O(l)] = -286.83 kJ/mol

S°[H2O(l)] = 70.0 J/(K mol)

ΔHf°[H2O(g)] = -241.82 kJ/mol

S°[H2O(g)] = 188.8 J/(K mol)

Combining 

ΔH° = ΔHf°[H2O(g)] - ΔHf°[H2O(l)]

ΔS° = S°[H2O(g)] - S°[H2O(l)]

T = 298 K

ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS°

At 298 K (25 °C) ΔG298°>0, and so boiling is nonspontaneous (not spontaneous).

Think about it: ΔH° for boiling water is positive because:

a) The freedom of particles increases

b) The freedom of particles decreases

c) You gain energy when breaking hydrogen bonds

d) You expend energy to break hydrogen bonds

!C2H6(g) -> H2(g) +C2H4(g)

<h4>Answer:</h4>

@ΔG298°=102.0 kJ/mol # the reaction is nonspontaneous (not spontaneous) at 25 °C

ΔG°[C2H6] = -32.0 kJ/mol

ΔG°[H2] =  0 kJ/mol

ΔG°[C2H4] = 68.4 kJ/mol

ΔᵣG° = ΔG°[H2] + ΔG°[C2H4] - ΔG°[C2H6]

Think about it: Looking at the chemical reaction, what could you have predicted:

a) That the entropy increases because the number of particles increases

a) That the entropy decreases because the number of particles increases

a) That the reaction is spontaneous because the number of particles increases

a) That the reaction is nonspontaneous  because the number of particles increases

A typical barometric pressure in Kansas City is 740 torr. What is this pressure in atmospheres, in millimeters of mercury, in kilopascals, and in bar?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

P_KansasCity = 740. mmHg

<h3>Example 9.2: Calculation of Barometric Pressure</h3>

Show the calculation supporting the claim that atmospheric pressure near sea level corresponds to the pressure exerted by a column of mercury that is about 760 mm high. The density of mercury = 13.6 g/cm^3.

<h4>Solution</h4>

h[Hg]column = 760. mm

ρ[Hg] = 13.6 g/cm^3

@P_hydrostatic = h_column ρ g0

g0 = 9.81 m/s^2

ρ_water = 1.00 kg/L

@P_hydrostatic = h_column ρ g0

g0 = 9.81 m/s^2

h_column = P_normal / (ρ_water g0)

<h3>Example 9.9: Using the Ideal Gas Law</h3>

Methane, CH4, is being considered for use as an alternative automotive fuel to replace gasoline. One gallon of gasoline could be replaced by 655 g of CH4. What is the volume of this much methane at 25 °C and 745 torr?

<h4>Solution</h4>

V[CH4] = ?

m[CH4] = 655. g

T = 25. °aC

P = 745. torr

@ P V_ = n R T

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

n[CH4] = m[CH4] / M[CH4]

V[CH4] = n[CH4] R T / P

It would require 1020 L (269 gal) of gaseous methane at about 1 atm of pressure to replace 1 gal of gasoline. It requires a large container to hold enough methane at 1 atm to replace several gallons of gasoline.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

Think about it: If the highest safe pressure for gas storage cylinders is 150 atm, would it be safe to transport the hydrogen gas under these conditions:
a) Yes, because the calculated pressure is lower than 150 atm

d) No, because the calculated pressure is higher than 150 atm




<h3>Example 9.10: Using the Combined Gas Law</h3>

When filled with air, a typical scuba tank with a volume of 13.2 L has a pressure of 153 atm (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_09_02_Scuba.jpg">Figure 16</a>).

<h3>Solution</h3>

V_tank = 13.2 L

P_tank = 153. atm

T_tank = 27. °aC

P_in_lungs = 3.13 atm

T_in_lungs = 37. °aC

V_in_lungs = ?

@ P1 V1/ T1 = P2 V2 / T2

(Note: Be advised that this particular example is one in which the assumption of ideal gas behavior is not very reasonable, since it involves gases at relatively high pressures and low temperatures. Despite this limitation, the calculated volume can be viewed as a good “ballpark” estimate.)





<h3>Example 9.11: Derivation of a Density Formula from the Ideal Gas Law</h3>

Use PV = nRT to derive a formula for the density of gas in g/L

<h4>Solution</h4>

@ P V_gas = n_gas R T

The density is defined as mass per volume. To get mass into the equation, multiply each side by the molar mass of the gas:

@ M_gas P V_gas =  m_gas R T

To have m_gas / V_gas on the right hand side, divide by V_gas, R, and T:

@ M_gas P / (R T) =  m_gas / V_gas

Finally, we can substiture ρ, the symbol for density to arrive at

@ ρ = m_gas / V_gas = M_gas P / (R T)



<h3>Example 9.11b: Derivation of a Density Formula from the Ideal Gas Law</h3>

A gas was found to have a density of 0.0847 g/L at 17.0 °C and a pressure of 760 torr. What is its molar mass? What is the gas?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

ρ_gas = 0.0847 g/L

T = 17.0 °aC

P = 760. torr

M_gas = ?

@ ρ_gas = P M_gas / (R T)

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)
n_gas_arbitrary = 1 mol
V_gas = n_gas_arbitrary R T / P
m_gas = V_gas ρ_gas

M_gas = m_gas / n_gas_arbitrary

The gas is H2(g)

Think about it: Howe does this density compare to that of liquid water?
a) Liquid water is less dense, ρ[H2O] = 1000 g/L
b) Liquid water is more dense, ρ[H2O] = 1000 g/L
c) Liquid water is less dense, ρ[H2O] = 1 g/L
d) Liquid water is more dense, ρ[H2O] = 1 g/L



<h3>Example 9.12: Empirical/Molecular Formula Problems Using the Ideal Gas Law and Density of a Gas</h3>

Cyclopropane, a gas once used with oxygen as a general anesthetic, is composed of 85.7% carbon and 14.3% hydrogen by mass. Find the empirical formula. If 1.56 g of cyclopropane occupies a volume of 1.00 L at 0.984 atm and 50 °C, what is the molecular formula for cyclopropane?

<h4>Solution</h4>

f_C = 0.857

f_H = 0.143

m_gas = 1.56 g

V_gas = 1.00 L

P = 0.984 atm

T = 50 °aC

Strategy 1: Figure out the mass of carbon and hydrogen from mass and mass fractions, and the respective chemical amounts via the molar mass of these elements. Then, figure out the chemical amount of the gas molecule via the ideal gas law. The ratio of amount of atom vs amount of molecule gives the coefficient for that type of atom.

m_C = f_C m_gas

m_H = f_H m_gas

n_C = m_C / M[C]

n_H = m_H / M[H]

Now we use the ideal gas law to figure out the chemical amount of the gas molecule:

@ P V_gas = n_molecule R T

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

n_molecule = P V_gas / (R T)

coeff_C = n_C / n_molecule

coeff_H = n_H / n_molecule

Molecular formula is C3H6

<hr>

Strategy 2: First solve the empirical formula problem using methods discussed earlier. Assume 1.56 g (because we actually know the mass of the sample). After calculating the chemical amounts of atoms as in strategy 1, divide by the smallest value (amount of carbon) to get the stoichiometric ratio n[C] : n[H]. In the last step, realize that the smallest whole number ratio is the empirical formula:

ratio[H : C] = n_H / n_C

The ratio of H to C is very close to 2, so the empirical formula is CH2, and we can calculate the molar mass of this empirical formula:

M[CH2] = M[CH2]

Then, we calculate the molar mass of the gas molecule by dividing the mass of the sample by the chemical amount (obtained from ideal gas law):

M_molecule = m_gas/ n_molecule

Because the molar mass of the molecule is about three time higher than that of the empirical formula, we have to multiply the subscripts in the empirical formula CH2 by three to obtain the molecular formula, C3H6.





<h3>Example 9.12b: Empirical/Molecular Formula Problems Using the Ideal Gas Law and Density of a Gas</h3>

Acetylene, a fuel used welding torches, is comprised of 92.3% C and 7.7% H by mass. Find the empirical formula. If 1.10 g of acetylene occupies of volume of 1.00 L at 1.15 atm and 59.5 °C, what is the molecular formula for acetylene?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

m_sample = 1.10 g

V_sample = 1.00 L

P = 1.15 atm

T = 59.5°aC

f_C = 0.923

f_H = 0.077

m_C = f_C * m_sample

m_H = f_H * m_sample

n_C = m_C / M[C]

n_H = m_H / M[H]

Amounts are equal, empirical formula is CH and the corresponding molar mass:

M[CH] = M[CH]

For molar mass of the molecule, we apply the ideal gas law to calculate the amount of molecule present in the sample

@ P V_gas = n R T

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

n_molecule = P V_sample / (R T)

M_molecule = m_sample / n_molecule

# This molar mass is twice as high as that for the empirical formula, so the molecular formula is C2H2

Empirical formula, CH; Molecular formula, C2H2

Think about it: Given that an atom of carbon has about 12 times the mass of an atom of hydrogen, what ratio of carbon to hydrogen could we have estimated from the given information:
a) There are many more carbon atoms than hydrogen atoms because the composition is so uneven (92% vs 8%).
a) There are many more hydrogen atoms than carbon atoms in acetylen because hydrogen atoms are so much lighter.
a) The ratio of masses and the ratio of percent composition by mass are similar, so the stoichiometry is close to 1:1.
a) We can't estimate anything without a calculator because there are too many numbers to juggle at the same time.

a) Increasing one coefficient and decreasing another on the product side, as long as their sum stays constant
b) Adding a pure element on the side of the reactants
c) Swapping reactants and products
d) Removing all species in the gas phase from the equation because they have no mass



<h3>Example 5.15b: Using Hess’s Law</h3>

Calculate the heat of combustion of 1 mole of ethanol, C2H5OH(l), when H2O(l) and CO2(g) are formed. Use the following enthalpies of formation: C2H5OH(l), -278 kJ/mol; H2O(l), -286 kJ/mol; and CO2(g), -394 kJ/mol.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

!C2H5OH + 7/2 O2 -> 2 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l)

ΔHf°[C2H5OH] = -278 kJ/mol

ΔHf°[H2O(l)] = -286 kJ/mol

ΔHf°[CO2(g)] = -394 kJ/mol

ΔHᵣ° =  sum(2 ΔHf°[CO2(g)], 3 ΔHf°[H2O(l)], -ΔHf°[C2H5OH])

Think about it: Why isn't the enthalpy of formation for dioxygen given in the question, even though dioxygen is part of all combustion reactions?
a) Because it is a gas and its enthalpy of formation is too little to be measure accurately.
b) Because it is an element, so its enthalpy of formation is zero by definition.
c) Because we only need enthalpies of formation for the products, which are formed.
d) Because you can calculate it easily from the value for CO2, which contains O2.



<h3>Example 2.1: Testing Dalton’s Atomic Theory</h3>

In the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element. The purple spheres represent atoms of another element. If the spheres touch, they are part of a single unit of a compound. Does the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s atomic theory? If so, which one?

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_02_01_Dalton6_img.jpg"}

<h4>Solution</h4>

The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres. The products consist of only one green sphere and one purple sphere. This violates Dalton’s postulate that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed. (In this case, atoms appear to have been destroyed.)

<h4>Answer:</h4>
There are 4 green atoms and 2 blue atoms on either side of the equation, so it is all good.



<h3>Example 2.2: Laws of Definite and Multiple Proportions</h3>

A sample of compound A (a clear, colorless gas) is analyzed and found to contain 4.27 g carbon and 5.69 g oxygen. A sample of compound B (also a clear, colorless gas) is analyzed and found to contain 5.19 g carbon and 13.84 g oxygen. Are these data an example of the law of definite proportions, the law of multiple proportions, or neither? What do these data tell you about substances A and B?

<h4>Solution</h4>

In compound A, the mass ratio of carbon to oxygen is:

m[C]_compA = 4.27 g

m[O]_compA = 5.69 g

r[C:O]_compA = m[C]_compA / m[O]_compA

In compound B, the mass ratio of carbon to oxygen is:

m[C]_compB = 5.19 g

m[O]_compB = 13.84 g

r[C:O]_compB = m[C]_compB / m[O]_compB

The ratios are different, so this is not the law of definite proportions (and compound A is different from compound B because it has different composition).

The ratio of these ratios is:

r_r = r[C:O]_compA / r[C:O]_compB

This supports the law of multiple proportions. This means that A and B are different compounds, with A having twice as much carbon per amount of oxygen (or twice as much oxygen per amount of carbon) as B. A possible pair of compounds that would fit this relationship would be compA = CO and compB = CO2.



<h3>Example 2.3: Composition of an Atom</h3>

Iodine is an essential trace element in our diet; it is needed to produce thyroid hormone. Insufficient iodine in the diet can lead to the development of a goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_02_03_Iodine.jpg">Figure 12</a>).

<img src="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_02_03_Iodine.jpg">Figure 12(a) Insufficient iodine in the diet can cause an enlargement of the thyroid gland called a goiter. (b) The addition of small amounts of iodine to salt, which prevents the formation of goiters, has helped eliminate this concern in the US where salt consumption is high. (credit a: modification of work by “Almazi”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Mike Mozart)

The addition of small amounts of iodine to table salt (iodized salt) has essentially eliminated this health concern in the United States, but as much as 40% of the world’s population is still at risk of iodine deficiency. The iodine atoms are added as anions, and each has a 1- charge and a mass number of 127. Determine the numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in one of these iodine anions.

<h4>Solution</h4>The atomic number of iodine (53) tells us that a neutral iodine atom contains 53 protons in its nucleus and 53 electrons outside its nucleus. 

protons[I atom] = 53

electrons[I atom] = protons[I atom]

Because the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons equals the mass number, 127, the number of neutrons is

number_mass = 127

neutrons[I atom] = number_mass - protons[I atom]

Since the iodine is added as a 1- anion, the number of electrons in the ion is

electrons[I- ion] = electrons[I atom] + 1

The number of protons and neutrons is the same as in the atom (no changes in the nucleus during ionization)



<h3>Example 2.3b: Composition of an Atom</h3>

An ion of platinum has a mass number of 195 and contains 74 electrons. How many protons and neutrons does it contain, and what is its charge?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

From the periodic table, we read off the number of protons:

protons = 78

Protons and neutrons contribute to the mass number (the mass of the electrons can be neglected as it is smaller by three orders of magnitude).

neutrons = 195 - protons

Protons have positive charge and electrons have negative charge, so the charge of protons and electrons combined is:

electrons = 74

charge = protons - electrons



<h3>Example 2.7b: Naming Groups of Elements</h3>

<h3>Example 2.3b: Composition of an Atom</h3>

An ion of platinum has a mass number of 195 and contains 74 electrons. How many protons and neutrons does it contain, and what is its charge?

<h4>Answer:</h4>
@ A[Pt] = N[p+ + n^0] ! The mass number A is equal to the number of protons and neutrons

N[p+ + n^0] = 195 

N[e-] = 74
N_charge = ?  
N[n^0] = ?

N[p+] = 78

N[n^0] = N[p+ + n^0] -N[p+] 

N_charge = N[p+] -N[e-] 

The charge is plus four, so it is a Pt(IV)-ion 

Think about it: Why is this ion charged?

1) All elements that are metals are charged always

2) There are more neutrons than protons in the nucleus

3) There are more protons than neutrons in the nucleus

4) The number of protons and electrons is unequal



<h3>Example 2.4b: Calculation of Average Atomic Mass</h3>

A sample of magnesium is found to contain 78.70% of ^24Mg atoms (mass 23.98 amu), 10.13% of ^25Mg atoms (mass 24.99 amu), and 11.17% of ^26Mg atoms (mass 25.98 amu). Calculate the average mass of a Mg atom.

<h4>Answer:</h4>
f[^24Mg] = 78.70  ％

m[^24Mg] = 23.98 Da 

f[^25Mg] = 10.13 ％

m[^25Mg] = 24.99 Da

f[^26Mg] = 11.17 ％

m[^26Mg] = 25.98 Da 

m_average = f[^24Mg] m[^24Mg] +f[^25Mg] m[^25Mg] +f[^26Mg] m[^26Mg] 

Think about it: Is this average mass reasonable?

a) Yes, because it is higher than the highest isotopic mass

b) Yes, because it is lower than the lowest isotopic mass

c) Yes, because it is close to the mass of the common isotope

d) No, because it is inbetween the three masses



<h3>Example 2.5b: Calculation of Percent Abundance</h3>

Naturally occurring copper consists of ^63Cu (mass 62.9296 amu) and ^65Cu (mass 64.9278 amu), with an average mass of 63.546 amu. What is the percent composition of Cu in terms of these two isotopes?

<h4>Answer:</h4>
m[lo] = 62.9296 Da 

m[hi] = 64.9278 Da 

m_average = 63.546 Da

f[lo] = ? 

f[hi] = ? 

@ m_average = f[lo] m[lo] + f[hi] m[hi]

@ f[lo] + f[hi] = 1 

Substitute 1 - f[lo] = f[hi] to eliminate f[hi] 

@  m_average = f[lo] m[lo] + (1 - f[lo]) m[hi] 

Now solve for f[lo]

@  m_average = f[lo] m[lo] + m[hi] - f[lo] m[hi] 

@  m_average = f[lo] (m[lo] - m[hi]) + m[hi]  

@  m_average - m[hi] = f[lo] (m[lo] - m[hi]) 

@  (m_average - m[hi]) / (m[lo] - m[hi]) = f[lo]

f[lo] = (m_average - m[hi]) / (m[lo] - m[hi]) * 100％

f[hi] = 1 - f[lo] 

The sample contains 69.15 % 63-Cu and 30.85% 65-Cu

Think about it: Could you have predicted that the sample contains more 63-Cu and less 65-Cu?

a) Yes, because the isotopes with lower mass are more stable.

b) No, because the isotopes with lower mass are less stable.

c) Yes, because the average mass is closer to that of 63-Cu.

d) No, because the average mass is closer to that of 65-Cu

Think about it: What can we say about the coefficients of a molecular formula (such as C11H18) that is equal to its corresponding empirical formula?

a) All of the coefficients are even

<h3>Example 2.4: Calculation of Average Atomic Mass</h3>

A meteorite found in central Indiana contains traces of the noble gas neon picked up from the solar wind during the meteorite’s trip through the solar system. Analysis of a sample of the gas showed that it consisted of 91.84% ^20Ne (mass 19.9924 Da), 0.47% ^21Ne (mass 20.9940 Da), and 7.69% ^22Ne (mass 21.9914 Da). What is the average mass of the neon in the solar wind?

<h4>Solution</h4>

f[20] = 91.84 ％

f[21] = 0.47 ％

f[22] = 7.69 ％

m[20] = 19.9924 Da

m[21] = 20.9940 Da

m[22] = 21.9914 Da

m_average = ?

m_average = f[20] m[20] +f[21] m[21] +f[22] m[22] 

The average mass of the neon in the solar wind is 20.151 Da. (The average mass of a terrestrial neon atom is 20.1796 Da. This result demonstrates that we may find slight differences in the natural abundance of isotopes, depending on their origin.)



<h3>Example 2.5: Calculation of Percent Abundance</h3>

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of ^35Cl (mass 34.96885 Da) and ^37Cl (mass 36.96590 Da), with an average mass of 35.453 Da. What is the percent composition of Cl in terms of these two isotopes?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m[35] = 34.96885 Da

m[37] = 36.96590 Da

m_average = 35.453 Da

f[37] = ?

f[35] = ?

The average mass of chlorine is the fraction that is ^35Cl times the mass of ^35Cl plus the fraction that is ^37Cl times the mass of ^37Cl.

@ m_average = f[35] m[35] + f[37] m[37]@[Equation 1]

The fraction that is ^35Cl and the fraction that is ^37Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of ^37Cl must equal 1 minus the fraction of ^35Cl

@ f[37] = 1 - f[35] @[Equation 2]

Substituting equation 2 into equation 1 gives

@ m_average = f[35] m[35] + (1 - f[35])m[37]

Now we have an equation with a single unknown f[35], we can solve for it and calculate it:

@ f[35]m[37] - f[35] m[35] = m[37] - m_average @ ...terms with f[35] on the left

@ f[35](m[37] - m[35]) = m[37] - m_average @ ...isolated f[35] on the left

@ f[35] = (m[37] - m_average)/(m[37] - m[35]) @ ...solved for f[35]

f[35] = (m[37] - m_average)/(m[37] - m[35]) 100 ％

To determine f[37], we can use the fact that the relative ambundances add up to 1 (equation 2)

f[37] = 1 - f[35]

Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% ^35Cl and 24.24% ^37Cl.



<h3>Example 2.6: Empirical and Molecular Formulas</h3>

Molecules of glucose (blood sugar) contain 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. What are the molecular and empirical formulas of glucose?

<h4>Solution</h4>

The molecular formula is: 

!C6H12O6 !molecular formula

(because one molecule actually contains 6 C, 12 H, and 6 O atoms)

The empirical formula shows the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in a compound. We can take the numbers in the molecular formula and divide them all by the smallest number to get a tentative empirical formula. If all the numbers are whole numbers, we are done. If there are fractions such as halves or thirds, we have to multiply everything again (by 2 or 3, respectively) to arrive at the simplest whole-number ratio.

N[C] = 6

N[H] = 12

N[O] = 6

smallest = N[C] ! or N[O]

N[C]tentative = N[C] / smallest

N[H]tentative = N[H] / smallest

N[O]tentative = N[O] / smallest

In this case, all numbers are whole, so the simplest whole-number ratio C to H to O atoms in glucose is 1:2:1. (You are welcome to figure this out in your head if it is obvious to you from just looking at the formula.)

The empirical formula is:

!CH2O !empirical formula



<h3>Example 2.7: Naming Groups of Elements</h3>

Atoms of each of the following elements are essential for life. Give the group name for the following elements:

(a) chlorine

(b) calcium

(c) sodium

(d) sulfur

<h4>Solution</h4>

The family names are as follows (look on the periodic table to see which group - column - they are in; groups 1, 2, 16, 17 and 18 have common group names):

(a) chlorine: halogen

(b) calcium: alkaline earth metal

<h3>Example 2.8: Composition of Ions</h3>

An ion found in some compounds used as antiperspirants contains 13 protons and 10 electrons. What is its symbol?

<h4>Solution</h4>

N[p+] = 13

N[e-] = 10

Because the number of protons remains unchanged when an atom forms an ion, the atomic number of the element must be 13. Knowing this lets us use the periodic table to identify the element as Al (aluminum). The Al atom has lost three electrons and thus has three more positive charges (13) than it has electrons (10). 

N_charge = N[p+] - N[e-]

This is the aluminum cation, Al^3+.



<h3>Example 2.9: Formation of Ions</h3>

Magnesium and nitrogen react to form an ionic compound. Predict which forms an anion, which forms a cation, and the charges of each ion. Write the symbol for each ion and name them.

<h4>Solution</h4>

Magnesium’s position in the periodic table (group 2) tells us that it is a metal. Metals form positive ions (cations). A magnesium atom must lose two electrons to have the same number electrons as an atom of the previous noble gas, neon. Thus, a magnesium atom will form a cation with two fewer electrons than protons and a charge of 2^+. 

The symbol for and name of the ion is 

! Mg^2+ ! magnesium ion

Nitrogen’s position in the periodic table (group 15) reveals that it is a nonmetal. Nonmetals form negative ions (anions). A nitrogen atom must gain three electrons to have the same number of electrons as an atom of the following noble gas, neon. Thus, a nitrogen atom will form an anion with three more electrons than protons and a charge of 3^-. The symbol for and name of the ion is 

!N^3- ! nitride ion

<h4>Solution</h4>

Because the ionic compound must be electrically neutral, it must have the same number of positive and negative charges. 

Charge[Al^3+] = 3

Charge[O^2-] = -2
If you were to combine the ions in a 1:1 ratio, there would be an excess of positive charge.

Two aluminum ions, each with a charge of 3+, would give us six positive charges, and three oxide ions, each with a charge of 2-, would give us six negative charges. The formula and the dissociation equation would be 

! Al2O3 -> 2 Al^3+ + 3 O^2-

You can figure out that both the left hand side and the right hand side have a total charge of zero, either by looking at the chemical equation above or by using the calculator (see below):

@Charge_total = ν[Al^3+] Charge[Al^3+] + ν[O^2-] Charge[O^2-] = 0

ν[Al^3+] = 2

ν[O^2-] = 3

Charge_total = ν[Al^3+] Charge[Al^3+] + ν[O^2-] Charge[O^2-]



<h3>Example 2.11: Predicting the Formula of a Compound with a Polyatomic Anion</h3>

Baking powder contains calcium dihydrogen phosphate, an ionic compound composed of the ions Ca^2+ and H2PO4-. What is the formula of this compound?

<h4>Solution</h4>

The positive and negative charges must balance, and this ionic compound must be electrically neutral. Thus, we must have two negative charges to balance the 2+ charge of the calcium ion. This requires a ratio of one Ca^2+ ion to two H2PO4- ions. We designate this by enclosing the formula for the dihydrogen phosphate ion in parentheses and adding a subscript 2. The formula and dissociation equation is 

!Ca(H2PO4)2 -> Ca^2+ + 2 H2PO4-

Inspection or adding up the charges shows that with this stoichiometry, the ionic compound is indeed net neutral.

ν[Ca^2+] = 1

ν[H2PO4^2-] = 2

Charge[Ca^2+] = 2

Charge[H2PO4-] = -1

Charge_total  = ν[Ca^2+] Charge[Ca^2+] +ν[H2PO4^2-] Charge[H2PO4-] 



<h3>Example 2.12: Predicting the Type of Bonding in Compounds</h3>

(b) H2O2, the bleach and disinfectant hydrogen peroxide

(c) CHCl3, the anesthetic chloroform

(d) Li2CO3, a source of lithium in antidepressants

<h4>Solution</h4>

(a) Potassium (group 1) is a metal, and iodine (group 17) is a nonmetal; KI is predicted to be ionic.

(b) Hydrogen (group 1) is a nonmetal, and oxygen (group 16) is a nonmetal; H2O2 is predicted to be molecular.

(c) Carbon (group 14) is a nonmetal, hydrogen (group 1) is a nonmetal, and chlorine (group 17) is a nonmetal; CHCl3 is predicted to be molecular.

(d) Lithium (group 1) is a metal, and carbonate is a polyatomic ion; Li2CO3 is predicted to be ionic.

(a) Fe2S3

(b) CuSe

(c) GaN

(d) CrCl3

(e) Ti2(SO4)3

<h4>Solution</h4>The anions in these compounds have a fixed negative charge (S^2-, Se^2- , N^3-, Cl^-, and SO4^2-), and the compounds must be neutral. Because the total number of positive charges in each compound must equal the total number of negative charges, the positive ions must be Fe^3+, Cu^2+, Ga^3+, Cr^3+, and Ti^3+. These charges are used in the names of the metal ions:

(a) iron(III) sulfide

(b) copper(II) selenide

(c) gallium(III) nitride

(d) chromium(III) chloride

(e) titanium(III) sulfate

(a) SF6

(b) N2O3

(c) Cl2O7

(d) P4O6

<h4>Solution</h4>

Because these compounds consist solely of nonmetals, we use prefixes to designate the number of atoms of each element:

(a) sulfur hexafluoride

(b) dinitrogen trioxide

(c) dichlorine heptoxide

(d) tetraphosphorus hexoxide



<h3>Example 9.14: The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases</h3>

A 10.0 L vessel contains 2.50e-3 mol of H2, 1.00e-3 mol of He, and 3.00e-4 mol of Ne at 35 °C.

(a) What are the partial pressures of each of the gases?

(b) What is the total pressure in atmospheres?

<h4>Solution</h4>

V_gas = 10.0 L

n[H2] = 2.50e-3 mol

n[He] = 1.00e-3 mol

n[Ne] = 3.00e-4 mol

T = 35. °aC

The gases behave independently, so the partial pressure of each gas can be determined from the ideal gas equation, using P = n R T / V_gas:

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

R using atm L

P[H2] = n[H2] R T /V_gas 

P[He] = n[He] R T /V_gas 

P[Ne] = n[Ne] R T /V_gas
Because the gases behave independently, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures.

P_gas =  sum(P[H2], P[He], P[Ne])





<h3>Example 9.14b: The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases</h3>

A 5.73-L flask at 25 °C contains 0.0388 mol of N2, 0.147 mol of CO, and 0.0803 mol of H2. What is the total pressure in the flask in atmospheres?

<h4>Answer:</h4>
V_gas = 5.73 L

T = 25. °aC

n[N2] = 0.0388 mol

n[CO] = 0.147 mol

n[H2] = 0.0803 mol

@ P_total V_gas = n_total R T

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

R using atm L

n_total = n[N2] +n[CO] +n[H2] 

P_total = n_total R T / V_gas



Think about it: Estimate the chemical amount of gas per liter (i.e. the particle concentration) if 25. L of a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure contain about a mole of particles.

a) The concentration is about 4 mol/L

b) The concentration is about 0.4 mol/L

c) The concentration is about 0.04 mol/L (i.e. 40 mmol/L)

d) The concentration is about 4 mmol/L



<h3>Example 9.15: The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases</h3>

A gas mixture used for anesthesia contains 2.83 mol oxygen, O2, and 8.41 mol nitrous oxide, N2O. The total pressure of the mixture is 192 kPa.

(a) What are the mole fractions of O2 and N2O?

(b) What are the partial pressures of O2 and N2O?

<h4>Solution</h4>

n[O2] = 2.83 mol

n[N2O] = 8.41 mol

P_total = 192. kPa

X[O2] = ?

X[N2O] = ?

P[O2] = ?

P[N2O] = ?

Notice that the temperature is not given here, so we can't apply the ideal gas law. So instead, we will first calculate the mole fractions. The partial pressure of each component is equal to the total pressure times its mole fraction.

n_total = n[O2] + n[N2O] 

X[O2] = n[O2] /n_total 

X[N2O] = n[N2O] /n_total 

P[O2] = X[O2] P_total 

P[N2O] = X[N2O] P_total 

To check your result, make sure the mole fractions add up to one and the partial pressures add up to the total pressure.





<h3>Example 9.15b: The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases</h3>

What is the pressure of a mixture of 0.200 g of H2, 1.00 g of N2, and 0.820 g of Ar in a container with a volume of 2.00 L at 20 °C?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

m[H2]=0.200g

m[N2]=1.00g

m[Ar] = 0.820g

V_gas = 2.00 L

T = 20. °aC

P_total = ?

n[H2] =m[H2]/M[H2]

n[Ar] =m[Ar]/M[Ar]

n[N2] =m[N2]/M[N2] 

n_total = sum(n[H2] ,n[Ar] ,n[N2] )

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

R using Pa L

P_total = n_total R T /V_gas 



Think about it: What statement about the calculated pressure is true?

a) It is higher than atmospheric pressure because the particles are less crowded than those in air

b) It is higher than atmospheric pressure because the particles are more crowded than those in air

c) It is lower than atmospheric pressure because the particles are less crowded than those in air

d) It is lower than atmospheric pressure because the particles are more crowded than those in air



<h3>Example 9.16: Pressure of a Gas Collected Over Water</h3>

If 0.200 L of argon is collected over water at a temperature of 26 °C and a pressure of 750 torr in a system like that shown in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_09_03_WaterVapor.jpg">Figure 21</a>, what is the partial pressure of argon?

<h4>Solution</h4>

P[Ar] = ?

V[Ar] = 0.200 L

P_total = 750. torr

T = 26. °aC

According to Dalton’s law, the total pressure in the bottle (750 torr) is the sum of the partial pressure of argon and the partial pressure of gaseous water:

@P_total = P[Ar] + P[H2O]

The pressure of water vapor above a sample of liquid water at 26 °C is 25.2 torr (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/back-matter/water-properties/">Appendix E</a>):

P[H2O] = 25.2 torr

Now we can calculate the partial pressure:

P[Ar] = P_total -P[H2O] 

Notice that we did not make use of the volume information (we can't use the ideal gas law to calculate the pressure because the chemical amount of argon is unknown) and we made use of the temperture information indirectly when we looked up the partial pressure of water at this temperature.



<h3>Example 9.16b: Pressure of a Gas Collected Over Water</h3>

A sample of oxygen collected over water at a temperature of 29.0 °C and a pressure of 764 torr has a volume of 0.560 L. What volume would the dry oxygen have under the same conditions of temperature and pressure?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

P[H2O]25 = 23.8 torr

P[H2O]30 = 31.8 torr

P[H2O]29 = P[H2O]25 + (P[H2O]30 - P[H2O]25)(29 - 25)/(30 - 25) 

T = 29.0 °aC

P = 764. torr

V_gas = 0.560 L

Plan 1) P[O2] 2) n[O2] 3) P°[O2]

P[O2] = P - P[H2O]29 

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

n[O2] = P[O2] V_gas / (R T )

V°[O2] = n[O2] R T / P  



Or use Boyle's Law for a quicker calculation:

@ V°[O2] P = V_gas (P - P[H2O]29)

Think about it: Does a given amount of O2 particles occupy more or less space in the presence of humidity (constant temperature and total pressure)?

a) More space because the water molecules also need space

b) Less space because water molecules are smaller than O2 molecules

c) More space because of the collisions between water and O2

d) Less space because the oxygen and the water combine to form a new molecule



<h3>Example 9.17: Reaction of Gases</h3>

Propane, C3H8(g), is used in gas grills to provide the heat for cooking. What volume of O2(g) measured at 25 °C and 760 torr is required to react with 2.7 L of propane measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure? Assume that the propane undergoes complete combustion.

<h4>Solution</h4>

The ratio of the volumes of C3H8 and O2 will be equal to the ratio of their coefficients in the balanced equation for the reaction:

!C3H8(g) +5O2(g)   ->   3CO2(g) +4H2O(l)

From the equation, we see that one volume of C3H8 will react with five volumes of O2:

@ V[C3H8] / ν[C3H8] = V[O2] / ν[O2(g)]

ν[C3H8(g)] = 1

ν[O2(g)] = 5

V[C3H8] = 2.7 L

V[O2] = ?

V[O2] = V[C3H8]  (ν[O2(g)] /ν[C3H8(g)])

!2C2H2 +5O2 -> 4CO2 +2H2O

<h4>Answer:</h4>

tanks = 7.00e3L

ν[C2H2] = 2

ν[O2] = 5

V[C2H2]reaction =  9340. L

N_tank[O2] = V[O2]reaction / tanks

Think about it: The volume of oxygen coming out of a tank, 7000 L, is about twenty bathtubs worth. How can workers get sufficient oxygen to their work site:
a) The tanks are sleeker than bathtubs, so they don't look as big
b) The oxygen molecules are smaller when under pressure, so they use up less space
c) The oxygen molecules are closer together in the tank, using less space
d) The workers extract the oxygen from air with a machine inside the tank enclosure

<h4>Answer:</h4>

! O2(g) + C2H4(g) -> CO2(g) + H2O(g) ! not balanced

!3O2(g) + C2H4(g) -> 2CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) ! balanced

ν[O2(g)] = 3

The pressure of the gas is equal to a column of mercury of height 26.4 cm. (The pressure at the bottom horizontal line is equal on both sides of the tube. The pressure on the left is due to the gas and the pressure on the right is due to 26.4 cm Hg, or mercury.) We could use the equation p = hρg as in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/9-1-gas-pressure/#fs-idm5509408">Example 1</a>, but it is simpler to just convert between units using <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/9-1-gas-pressure/#fs-idp189967312">Table 1</a>.

<h3>Example 9.4: Calculation of Pressure Using an Open-End Manometer</h3>

<h3>Example 9.6: Predicting Change in Volume with Temperature</h3>

A sample of carbon dioxide, CO2, occupies 0.300 L at 10 °C and 750 torr. What volume will the gas have at 30 °C and 750 torr?

<h4>Solution</h4>

V1 = 0.300 L

T1 = 10. °aC

T2 = 30. °aC

V2 = ?

Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at constant pressure, this is a job for Charles’s law. Taking V1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature at which the volume is unknown and V2 as the unknown volume we have:

@ V1/T1=V2/T2

Rearranging and solving gives: 

V2 = V1 (T2/T1)

This answer supports our expectation from Charles’s law, namely, that raising the gas temperature (from 283 K to 303 K) at a constant pressure will yield an increase in its volume (from 0.300 L to 0.321 L).

(a) Estimating from the P-V graph gives a value for P somewhere around 27 psi.

(b) Estimating from the 1/P versus V graph give a value of about 26 psi.

(c) From Boyle’s law, we know that the product of pressure and volume (PV) for a given sample of gas at a constant temperature is always equal to the same value. Therefore we have 

@P1 V1 = P2 V2

Solving for the unknown P2:

P2 = P1 (V1/V2)

P2 in psi

It was more difficult to estimate well from the P-V graph, so (a) is likely more inaccurate than (b) or (c). The calculation will be as accurate as the equation and measurements allow.



<h3>Example 9.8b: Volume of a Gas Sample</h3>

The sample of gas in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_09_03_BoylesLaw1.jpg">Figure 13</a> has a volume of 30.0 mL at a pressure of 6.5 psi. Determine the volume of the gas at a pressure of 11.0 psi, using:

Comment on the likely accuracy of each method.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

psi = 6894.76 Pa

V1 = 30.0 mL

P1 = 6.5 psi

P2 = 11.0 psi

V2 = ?

@ P1 V1 = P2 V2 

V2 = V1 (P1 /P2 )

Think about it: The volume...

a) went up because the pressure went down

a) went up because the pressure went up

a) went down because the pressure went down

a) went down because the pressure went up



<h3>Example 9.10b: Using the Combined Gas Law</h3>

A sample of ammonia is found to occupy 0.250 L under laboratory conditions of 27 °C and 0.850 atm. Find the volume of this sample at 0 °C and 1.00 atm.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

V1 = 0.250 L

T1 = 27. °aC

P1 = 0.850 atm

T2 = 0. °aC

P2 = 1.00 atm

@ P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2

V2 = ?

V2 = V1 (P1 /P2 ) (T2 / T1)

Think about it: The volume...

a) decreased because the pressure decreased while the temperature increased

<h3>Example 9.18: Volumes of Reacting Gases</h3>

Ammonia is an important fertilizer and industrial chemical. Suppose that a volume of 683 billion cubic feet of gaseous ammonia, measured at 25 °C and 1 atm, was manufactured. What volume of H2(g), measured under the same conditions, was required to prepare this amount of ammonia by reaction with N2?

!N2(g) +3H2(g) -> 2NH3(g)

<h4>Solution</h4>

ν[H2(g)] = 3

ν[NH3(g)] = 2

ft = 12 2.54 cm

V[NH3] = 683e9 ft^3

V[H2] = ?

Because equal volumes of H2 and NH3 contain equal numbers of molecules and each three molecules of H2 that react produce two molecules of NH3, the ratio of the volumes of H2 and NH3 will be equal to 3:2. Two volumes of NH3, in this case in units of billion ft^3, will be formed from three volumes of H2:

V[H2] = V[NH3]  (ν[H2(g)] / ν[NH3(g)])

V[H2] in ft^3

The manufacture of 683 billion ft^3 of NH3 required 1020 billion ft^3 of H2. (At 25 °C and 1 atm, this is the volume of a cube with an edge length of approximately 1.9 miles.)

Think about it: Why do we need a larger volume of H2 than the volume of the produced NH3?

a) Because the molar mass of NH3 is larger

b) Because NH3 has more atoms than H2

c) Because H2 is more reactive than NH3

d) Because they react in a 3:2 ratio



<h3>Example 9.19: Volume of Gaseous Product</h3>

What volume of hydrogen at 27 °C and 723 torr may be prepared by the reaction of 8.88 g of gallium with an excess of hydrochloric acid?

!2Ga(s) +6HCl(aq) -> 2GaCl3(aq) +3H2(g)

<h4>Solution</h4>

T_gas = 27. °aC

P_gas = 723. torr

m[Ga] = 8.88 g 

To convert from the mass of gallium to the volume of H2(g), we need to do something like this:

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_09_03_Example3_img.jpg"}

ν[Ga(s)] = 2

ν[H2(g)] = 3

V_gas = ?

n[Ga] = m[Ga] / M[Ga] 

n[H2] = n[Ga] (ν[H2(g)] /ν[Ga(s)] )

@ P_gas V_gas = n_gas R T_gas

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

V_gas = n[H2] R T_gas /P_gas 

Then, we can use the ideal gas law:



<h3>Example 9.5: Predicting Change in Pressure with Temperature</h3>

A can of hair spray is used until it is empty except for the propellant, isobutane gas.

(a) On the can is the warning “Store only at temperatures below 120 °F (48.8 °C). Do not incinerate.” Why?

(b) The gas in the can is initially at 24 °C and 360 kPa, and the can has a volume of 350 mL. If the can is left in a car that reaches 50 °C on a hot day, what is the new pressure in the can?

<h4>Solution</h4>

T1 = 24. °aC

V_gas = 350. mL

P1 = 360. kPa

P2 = ?

T2 = 50. °aC

(a) The can contains an amount of isobutane gas at a constant volume, so if the temperature is increased by heating, the pressure will increase proportionately. High temperature could lead to high pressure, causing the can to burst. (Also, isobutane is combustible, so incineration could cause the can to explode.)

(b) We are looking for a pressure change due to a temperature change at constant volume, so we will use Amontons’s/Gay-Lussac’s law. Taking P1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature where the pressure is unknown and P2 as the unknown pressure, we have:

@ P1/T1 = P2/T2 

which means that

P2 = P1 (T2/ T1)



<h3>Example 9.7: Measuring Temperature with a Volume Change</h3>

Temperature is sometimes measured with a gas thermometer by observing the change in the volume of the gas as the temperature changes at constant pressure. The hydrogen in a particular hydrogen gas thermometer has a volume of 150.0 cm^3 when immersed in a mixture of ice and water (0.00 °C). When immersed in boiling liquid ammonia, the volume of the hydrogen, at the same pressure, is 131.7 cm^3. Find the temperature of boiling ammonia on the kelvin and Celsius scales.

<h4>Solution</h4>

V1 = 150.0 cm^3

T1 = 0.00 °aC

V2 = 131.7 cm^3

T2 = ?

A volume change caused by a temperature change at constant pressure means we should use Charles’s law. Taking V1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature at which the volume is unknown and V2 as the unknown volume we have:

@ V1/T1 = V2/T2

@ V1 T2 = V2 T1

which means that

T2 = T1 (V2 / V1)

T2 using °aC

<h3>Example 1.1: Calculation of Density</h3>

<p>

<h4>Calculation of Density</h4>

Gold—in bricks, bars, and coins—has been a form of currency for centuries. In order to swindle people into paying for a brick of gold without actually investing in a brick of gold, people have considered filling the centers of hollow gold bricks with lead to fool buyers into thinking that the entire brick is gold. It does not work: Lead is a dense substance, but its density is not as great as that of gold, 19.3 g/cm^3. What is the density of lead if a cube of lead has an edge length of 2.00 cm and a mass of 90.7 g?</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

edge_cube = 2.00 cm

m_lead = 90.7 g

The density ρ of a substance can be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume.

@ ρ_substance = m_substance / V_substance

The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the edge length.

V_cube = edge_cube ^ 3

ρ_lead = m_lead / V_cube



<h3>Example 1.1b: Calculation of Density</h3>

(a) To three decimal places, what is the volume of a cube (cm^3) with an edge length of 0.843 cm?

(b) If the cube in part (a) is copper and has a mass of 5.34 g, what is the density of copper to two decimal places?

<h4>Answer:</h4>

edge_cube = 0.843 cm

m_copper = 5.34 g

ρ_copper = ?

V_cube = edge_cube ^ 3

ρ_copper = m_copper /V_cube 





<h3>Example 1.2: Using Displacement of Water to Determine Density</h3>

This <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phetmasvolden">PhET simulation</a> illustrates another way to determine density, using displacement of water. Determine the density of the red and yellow blocks.

<h4>Solution</h4>

When you open the density simulation and select Same Mass, you can choose from several 5.00-kg colored blocks that you can drop into a tank containing 100.00 L water. The yellow block floats (it is less dense than water), and the water level rises to 105.00 L. While floating, the yellow block displaces 5.00 L water, an amount equal to the weight of the block. The red block sinks (it is more dense than water, which has density = 1.00 kg/L), and the water level rises to 101.25 L.

The red block therefore displaces 1.25 L water, an amount equal to the volume of the block. 

V_red_block = 1.25 L

m_red_block = 5.00 kg

The density of the red block is:

ρ_red = m_red_block / V_red_block

Note that since the yellow block is not completely submerged, you cannot determine its density from this information. But if you hold the yellow block on the bottom of the tank, the water level rises to 110.00 L, which means that it now displaces 10.00 L water, and its density can be found:

V_yellow_block = 10.00 L

m_yellow_block = 5.00 kg

ρ_yellow = m_yellow_block / V_yellow_block



<h3>Example 1.2b: Using Displacement of Water to Determine Density</h3>

Remove all of the blocks from the water and add the green block to the tank of water, placing it approximately in the middle of the tank. Determine the density of the green block. (If the link doesn't work, note that the volume of the block is 2.5 L and the mass is 5.00 kg

<h4>Answer:</h4>

V_block = 2.5 L

m_block = 5.00 kg

ρ_block = ?

ρ_block = m_block /V_block

(c) 0.051065 (to four significant figures)

(d) 0.90275 (to four significant figures)

In PQcalc, the easiest way to round is to multiply by 1. If you want two significant figures, multiply by 1.0 (which has two significant figures), if you want three significant figures, multiply by 1.00 (which has three significant figures), and so on.

(b) 8.1649 rounds “down” to 8.16 (the dropped digit, 4, is less than 5)

(c) 0.051065 rounds “down” to 0.05106 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)

<h3>Example 1.7: Experimental Determination of Density Using Water Displacement</h3>

A piece of rebar is weighed and then submerged in a graduated cylinder partially filled with water, with results as shown.

{"https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_01_04_CylRebar.jpg"}

(a) Use these values to determine the density of this piece of rebar.

(b) Rebar is mostly iron. Does your result in (a) support this statement? How?

<h4>Solution</h4>

m_rebar = 69.658 g

The volume of the piece of rebar is equal to the volume of the water displaced:

V_initial = 13.5 mL

V_final = 22.4 mL

V_rebar = V_final - V_initial

(rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL, per the rule for addition and subtraction)

The density is the mass-to-volume ratio:

ρ_rebar = m_rebar / V_rebar

(rounded to two significant figures, per the rule for multiplication and division)

From <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/measurements/#fs-idm45639696">Table 4</a>, the density of iron is 7.9 g/cm^3, very close to that of rebar, which lends some support to the fact that rebar is mostly iron.

<h4>Answer:</h4>

m_yellow_metal = 51.842 g #@!#@!Known_from_picture

Think about it: How does the density compare to that of water (water has a density of ~1 g/mL)?
a) It is lower because it sank to the bottom
b) It is higher because it sank to the bottom
c) It is lower because it floats at the surface
d) It is higher because it floats at the surface



<h3>Example 1.8: Using a Unit Conversion Factor</h3>

The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit conversion factor derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g (<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/mathematical-treatment-of-measurement-results/#fs-idm222237232">Table 6</a>).

<h4>Solution</h4>

If we have the conversion factor, we can determine the mass in kilograms using an equation similar the one used for converting length from inches to centimeters.

@ xoz=125 g×unit conversion factor

We write the unit conversion factor in its two forms:

@ 1 oz/28.349 g = 1 = 28.349 g/1 oz

The correct unit conversion factor is the ratio that cancels the units of grams and leaves ounces. In this case, it is the one with grams in the denominator, i.e. the first one.

In PQcalc, you first have to teach it what an oz is:

oz = 28.349 g

Then, you write down the known mass:

m_frisbee = 125. g

Then, you use the "in" command to get the mass in oz.

m_frisbee in oz

<h4>Answer:</h4>

qt = 0.9463 L

V_ = 9.345 qt

Think about it: What happens to the number when we convert from quarts to liters?
a) The number gets a lot larger because we are switching to liters, which are a lot smaller than quarts.
b) The number gets a bit larger because we are switching to liters, which are a bit smaller than quarts.
c) The number gets a bit smaller because we are switching to liters, which are a bit larger than quarts.

<h3>Example 1.9: Computing Quantities from Measurement Results and Known Mathematical Relations</h3>

What is the density of common antifreeze in units of g/mL? A 4.00-qt sample of the antifreeze weighs 9.26 lb.

<h4>Solution</h4>

Since density=mass/volume, we need to divide the mass in grams by the volume in milliliters. In general: the number of units of B = the number of units of A × unit conversion factor. The necessary conversion factors are given in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/mathematical-treatment-of-measurement-results/#fs-idm222237232">Table 6</a>:

lb = 453.59 g

While being driven from Philadelphia to Atlanta, a distance of about 1250 km, a 2014 Lamborghini Aventador Roadster uses 213 L gasoline.

(a) What (average) fuel economy, in miles per gallon, did the Roadster get during this trip?

(b) If gasoline costs $3.80 per gallon, what was the fuel cost for this trip?

Conversion factors are listed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Textbook_Maps/General_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Map%3A_Chemistry_(OpenSTAX)/Appendices/Units_and_Conversion_Factors">appendix</a>.

<h4>Solution</h4>

distance = 1250. km

V_gasoline = 213. L

(a) We calculate the mileage (which comes out in weird units) and then convert the units:

mileage = distance / V_gasoline

mileage using L km

mile = (1/0.62137) km

gallon = 3.78541 L

mileage in (mile/gallon)

(b) We find:

price_fuel = 3.80 $/gallon

cost_fuel = price_fuel V_gasoline
